## Telegram removed from Apple’s App Store due to ‘inappropriate content’ | The Verge httpbit.ly2nyPAJl

-            Apple has removed Telegram’s official app from its iOS App Store.

- The app disappeared yesterday, shortly after Telegram launched a rewritten Telegram X app for Android.

- Telegram X is currently in testing on iOS, and it was also removed from the App Store.

- “We were alerted by Apple that inappropriate content was made available to our users and both apps were taken off the App Store,” says Telegram CEO Pavel Durov.

- “Once we have protections in place we expect the apps to be back on the App Store.” It’s not clear when Telegram will return to the App Store, or what inappropriate content was found on the messaging service.

- TechCrunch reports that Apple’s iOS guidelines make it clear there must be filters for objectionable material, mechanisms to report it, and the ability to block users from the service.

- It’s possible that some content was making it through any filters in place.

- We were alerted by Apple that inappropriate content was made available to our users and both apps were taken off the App Store.

## AutoSploit

-  As the name might suggest AutoSploit attempts to automate the exploitation of remote hosts.

- Targets are collected automatically as well by employing the Shodan.io API.

- The program allows the user to enter their platform specific search query such as; Apache, IIS, etc, upon which a list of candidates will be retrieved.

- After this operation has been completed the 'Exploit' component of the program will go about the business of attempting to exploit these targets by running a series of Metasploit modules against them.

- Which Metasploit modules will be employed in this manner is determined by programmatically comparing the name of the module to the initial search query.

- However, I have added functionality to run all available modules against the targets in a 'Hail Mary' type of attack as well.

- The available Metasploit modules have been selected to facilitate Remote Code Execution and to attempt to gain Reverse TCP Shells and/or Meterpreter sessions.

- Workspace, local host and local port for MSF facilitated back connections are configured through the dialog that comes up before the 'Exploit' component is started.

## Chinese satellite uses quantum cryptography for secure video conference between continents

-  Quantum cryptography allows communication that is guaranteed to be secure, thanks to the laws of physics.

- And it is becoming increasingly important.

- Physicists have long known that quantum computers will be able to break almost all other types of cryptography.

- Since these devices are becoming more capable, the writing is on the wall for conventional encryption.

- So commercial businesses, governments, and the military are all waiting with bated breath for practical quantum cryptography systems to be developed.

- But there is a problem.

- The quantum cryptography relies on individual photons to carry quantum information.

- But even the best optical fibers can carry these photons only so far—around 200 kilometers—before light absorption makes the process impossible.

## Ransomware Hero to Receive FBI Award

-   The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced on Tuesday that it would be awarding the FBI Director’s Community Leadership Award to Michael Gillespie for his efforts in combating ransomware and helping users who fell victims to this threat.

- Gillespie is a member of the infosec community, known as the author of various ransomware decrypters, and the creator of ID Ransomware, RansomNoteCleaner, and CryptoSearch.

- Michael has been helping ransomware victims for years Michael is also known to most Bleeping Computer readers as Demonslay335, the username he uses on our forums, where for the past years he's been providing free support to ransomware victims.

- The FBI now wishes to acknowledge Michael's efforts during the past few years, both for the decrypters he created, the tools he built to help in identifying and cleaning ransomware infections, and the free support he's been providing on our forums and his personal Twitter profile.

- Lawrence Abrams, the owner of Bleeping Computer, first got to know Michael when he started volunteering his time by assisting TeslaCrypt victims factor their private keys in order to decrypt their files for free.

- Since then Michael has created several tools, with probably the most well-known being ID Ransomware.

- ID Ransomware is an online portal that allows victims to identify what ransomware they are infected with by uploading ransom notes or encrypted files.

- ID Ransomware will analyze the uploaded files and tell the victim what strain of ransomware has infected his computer, and attempt to provide file recovery and clean-up information, where available.
