## RCE Using Caller ID – Multiple Vulnerabilities in FusionPBX - Security Boulevard

-  Aon’s Cyber Solutions has recently discovered several vulnerabilities in FusionPBX, an open-source VoIP PBX application that runs on top of the FreeSWITCH VoIP switch.

- These vulnerabilities allow for novel exploitation vectors, including an exploit chain that is triggered by a phone call with a malicious caller ID value that leads to remote code execution.

- This post provides an overview of a selection of the discovered vulnerabilities, and details of the caller ID RCE exploit chain that combines CVE-2019-11408 and CVE-2019-11409.

- Future posts will cover additional FusionPBX vulnerabilities and their exploitation, including one triggered by sending a malicious fax.

- All vulnerabilities described in this post have been patched.Timeline:04/04/19 – Vulnerabilities disclosed to FusionPBX04/05/19 – Developer pushes preliminary patches to the project’s Github04/07/19 – Attempt to contact developer to discuss coordinated disclosure04/09/19 – Developer responds and states that they do not intend to publish advisory or otherwise disclose the existence of the vulnerabilities04/22/19 – CVE IDs obtained and shared with developer, 2nd request for coordination of public disclosure, no response received05/22/19 – Aon provides updated patch for CVE-2019-11409 in a pull request06/02/19 – Pull request accepted06/06/19 – Aon public disclosureVulnerability Listing / Credits:CVE-2019-11408: Dustin Cobb – XSS in Operator PanelCVE-2019-11409: Dustin Cobb – Command Injection in Operator PanelCVE-2019-11410: Dustin Cobb – Command Injection in Backup ModuleCVE-2019-11407: Dustin Cobb – Information disclosure through debug parameterDetails:CVE-2019-11408 – XSS in Operator PanelThe operator panel module in FusionPBX suffers from a serious XSS vulnerability in the index_inc.php file.

- The caller id number string isn’t properly output encoded before being rendered.

- The output of this file is used by the index.php file, which refreshes every 1500ms by making an ajax call to the index_inc.php file.

- The screen is designed to be used by a call center operator who wishes to monitor call activity on all of the extensions in the system.

## US border cops confirm: Maker of America's license-plate, driver recognition tech hacked, camera images swiped

-  The US Customs and Border Patrol today said hackers broke into one of its bungling technology subcontractors – and made off with images of people and their vehicle license plates as they passed through America's land border.

- The CBP issued a statement outlining how it learned on May 31 that the unnamed contractor, against Uncle Sam's privacy rules and security measures, copied license plate scans and traveler pictures to its own network, only to have that network breached by hackers and the data stolen.

- In an email to The Register, a spokesperson for the border cops said:  On May 31, 2019, CBP learned that a subcontractor, in violation of CBP policies and without CBP’s authorization or knowledge, had transferred copies of license plate images and traveler images collected by CBP to the subcontractor’s company network.

- The subcontractor’s network was subsequently compromised by a malicious cyber-attack.

- No CBP systems were compromised.

- Initial information indicates that the subcontractor violated mandatory security and privacy protocols outlined in their contract.

- As of today, none of the image data has been identified on the Dark Web or internet.

- CBP has alerted Members of Congress and is working closely with other law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity entities, and its own Office of Professional Responsibility to actively investigate the incident.

## Have I Been S0ld? Troy Hunt's security website is up for acquisition

-  Have I Been S0ld?

- Troy Hunt's security website is up for acquisition 'Time to grow up,' says geek behind breach database Poor security practice is common and there is much more that can be done, says Hunt   Troy Hunt, inventor and operator of the popular security website Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), is putting the service up for sale.

- Hunt, a Microsoft Regional Director and MVP for security, created the site in 2013 after Adobe leaked 153 million usernames and weakly encrypted passwords.

- Users can enter an email address and discover if it is included in the exposed data.

- You can also enter a password to see if it features in a data breach.

- The site was soon extended with data from other breaches and now contains nearly 8 billion records.

- HIBP publishes an API which gets over 12 million hits a day, most of them checking whether a password is safe to use.

- Mozilla's Firefox is one of a number of products that integrates with the API to help users choose strong passwords.

## Show HN: Kvmapp – A New Lightweight VM Manager for Linux

-  Simplifying VM Management on Linux KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) is the Linux virtualization technology intergrated into the Linux kernel.

- It's super efficient and performant but we found a lot of the userland tooling needlessly involved and overwrought.

- One of the effects of this has been the growing traction of other solutions on Linux.

- And this should give everyone pause.

- With KVM integrated why are users preferring something else?

- At Flockport we need to spin up a lot of VMs of various Linux distributions for testing everything from the Flockport installer to containers, networking and storage and we felt the existing solutions were involved and needlessly complex.

- At one point we remember spending hours debugging VXLAN issues only to discover libvirt was adding a large number of iptables rules that dropped VXLAN traffic and none of the rules were documented or their rationale.

- We feel there is already inbuilt complexity in networking, distributed storage, applications and scalability and adding needless complexity at the VM or container layer is an antipattern.

## Show HN: Tor_ssh.sh – One Command to Enable SSH via Tor to Any Ubuntu Server

-   VIDEO  At Grownetics we install onsite servers at our clients’ facilities so they can continue to use the system, even if their internet goes out.

- These servers have fail over connections, and may change connection at any time, and due to the onsite nature of things, we may not be able to have ports forwarded or expect there to be a static IP.

- In these cases a VPN is a nice thing to have, and we use Tinc for this.

- It works great, but it does require a cloud node to be accessible, and for various reasons that cloud node link can stop working.

- When it does, we could potentially lose access to these onsite servers, requiring a site visit to regain connectivity.

- This is less than ideal, and this is where Tor comes in.

- Using Tor hidden services, it is fairly trivial to set up an ssh access point that can be connected to pretty much as long as the server is powered and online.

- We use Ansible to automatically set Tor up for us on our new server deployments.

## Introducing Matrix 1.0 and the Matrix.org Foundation | Matrix.org blog

- Matrix 1.0Hi all,We are very excited to announce the first fully stable release of the Matrix protocol and specification across all APIs - as well as the Synapse 1.0 reference implementation which implements the full Matrix 1.0 API surface.This means that after just over 5 years since the initial work on Matrix began, we are proud to have finally exited beta!!

- This is the conclusion of the work which we announced at FOSDEM 2019 when we cut the first stable release of the Server-Server API and began the Synapse 0.99 release series in anticipation of releasing a 1.0.Now, before you get too excited, it’s critical to understand that Matrix 1.0 is all about providing a stable, self-consistent, self-contained and secure version of the standard which anyone should be able to use to independently implement production-grade Matrix clients, servers, bots and bridges etc.

- It does not mean that all planned or possible features in Matrix are now specified and implemented, but that the most important core of the protocol is a well-defined stable platform for everyone to build on.On the Synapse side, our focus has been exclusively on ensuring that Synapse correctly implements Matrix 1.0, to provide a stable and secure basis for participating in Matrix without risk of room corruption or other nastinesses.

- However, we have deliberately not focused on performance or features in the 1.0 release - so I’m afraid that synapse’s RAM footprint will not have got significantly better, and your favourite long-awaited features (automatically defragmenting rooms with lots of forward extremities, configurable message retention, admin management web-interface etc) have not yet landed.

- In other words, this is the opposite of the Riot 1.0 release (where the entire app was redesigned and radically improved its performance and UX) - instead, we have adopted the mantra to make it work, make it work right, and then (finally) make it fast.

- You can read the full release notes here.

- It’s also worth looking at the full changelog through the Synapse 0.99 release series to see the massive amount of polishing that’s been going on here.All this means that the main headline features which land in Matrix 1.0 are vitally important but relatively dry:Using X.509 certificates to trust servers rather than perspective notaries, to simplify and improve server-side trust.

- This is a breaking change across Matrix, and we’ve given the community several months now to ensure their homeservers run a valid TLS certificate.

## Project Svalbard: The Future of Have I Been Pwned

- Back in 2013, I was beginning to get the sense that data breaches were becoming a big thing.

- The prevalence of them seemed to be really ramping up as was the impact they were having on those of us that found ourselves in them, myself included.

- Increasingly, I was writing about what I thought was a pretty fascinating segment of the infosec industry; password reuse across Gawker and Twitter resulting in a breach of the former sending Acai berry spam via the latter.

- Sony Pictures passwords being, well, precisely the kind of terrible passwords we expect people to use but hey, actually seeing them for yourself is still shocking.

- And while I'm on Sony, the prevalence with which their users applied the same password to their Yahoo!

- accounts (59% of common email addresses had exactly the same password).Around this time the Adobe data breach happened and that got me really interested in this segment of the industry, not least because I was in there.

- Twice.

- Most significantly though, it contained 153M other people which was a massive incident, even by today’s standards.

## Microsoft NTLM Flaws Expose All Windows Machines to RCE Attacks

-   Two critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft's NTLM authentication protocol consisting of three logical flaws make it possible for attackers to run remote code and authenticate on machines running any Windows version.

- As Preempt's research team discovered, threat actors can "remotely execute malicious code on any Windows machine or authenticate to any web server that supports Windows Integrated Authentication (WIA) such as Exchange or ADFS."

- The Windows NTLM (short for NT LAN Manager) Authentication Protocol is used for client/server authentication purposes to authenticate remote users and to provide session security when requested by application protocols.

- The NTLM flaws unearthed by Preempt While Microsoft provides mitigations to block NTLM relay attacks, Preempt's research team was able to find several flaws in Redmond's mitigations that could be exploited by potential attackers.

- Microsoft added a Message Integrity Code (MIC) field designed to guarantee that attackers cannot tamper with NTLM messages in any way.

- However, the Preempt researchers found a bypass which enables attackers to remove the 'MIC' protection and alter various NTLM authentication flow fields, such as the signing negotiation.

- The SMB Session Signing implemented by Redmond to block "attackers from relaying NTLM authentication messages to establish SMB and DCE/RPC sessions" was also bypassed by the researchers.

- The bypass they found allows "attackers to relay NTLM authentication requests to any server in the domain, including domain controllers, while establishing a signed session to perform remote code execution."

## Radiohead refuses to pay $150,000 ransom for ‘hacked’ recordings, releases them instead

-   Radiohead refuses to pay $150,000 ransom for ‘hacked’ recordings, releases them instead     How do you stop a hacker from making a fortune out of the files they have stolen from you?

- Files that thousands of people are probably desperate to own?

- Simple.

- You make the files readily available to anyone on the internet to access.

- After all, there’s no way the hacker will be able to sell them for much now.

- That’s exactly how Radiohead has scuppered the plans of attempted extortionist who stole previously unreleased recordings and alternative takes made during the making of the band’s classic album OK Computer in 1997.

- Lead singer Thom Yorke announced the limited release of the recordings on Bandcamp would be in support of international conservation movement Extinction Rebellion.

- we’ve been hacked my archived mini discs from 1995-1998(?)

## Maine governor signs ISP privacy bill

- Less than one week after Maine Governor Janet Mills received one of the nation’s most privacy-protective state bills on her desk, she signed it into law.

- The move makes Maine the latest US state to implement its own online privacy protections.

- The law, which will go into effect July 1, 2020, blocks Internet service providers (ISPs) from selling, sharing, or granting third parties access to their customers’ data unless explicitly given approval by those customers.

- With the changes, Maine residents now have an extra layer of protection for the emails, online chats, browser history, IP addresses, and geolocation data that is commonly collected and stored by companies like Verizon, Comcast, and Spectrum.

- In signing the bill, Governor Mills said the people of Maine
“value their privacy, online and off.” 
“The Internet is a powerful tool, and as it becomes increasingly intertwined with our lives, it is appropriate to take steps to protect the personal information and privacy of Maine people,” said Governor Mills in a released statement.

- “With this common-sense law, Maine people can access the Internet with the knowledge and comfort that their personal information cannot be bought or sold by their ISPs without their express approval.”
The bill, titled “An Act to Protect the Privacy of Online Customer Information,” was introduced earlier this year by its sponsor, Democratic state Senator Shenna Bellows.

- It passed through the Maine Legislature’s Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Technology, and gained approval both in the House of Representatives and the Senate soon after.

- Given until June 11 to sign the bill into law, Governor Mills moved quick, giving her signature on June 6.

## Intel NUC Firmware Open to Privilege Escalation, DoS and Information Disclosure

-  Intel has patched seven high-severity vulnerabilities in its mini PC NUC kit firmware.

- Intel has patched seven high-severity vulnerabilities in the system firmware of its Intel NUC (short for Next Unit of Computing), a mini-PC kit used for gaming, digital signage and more.

- Overall, the chip-maker patched 25 vulnerabilities across various platforms this week – including eight high-severity flaws, 13 medium-severity flaws and four low-severity glitches.

- The majority of the high-severity flaws resided in the system firmware of Intel’s NUC mini PC kit, which offers processing, memory and storage capabilities for applications like digital signage, media centers and kiosks.

- “Potential security vulnerabilities in system firmware for Intel NUC may allow escalation of privilege, denial of service and/or information disclosure,” according to Intel’s Tuesday advisory.

- “Intel is releasing firmware updates to mitigate these potential vulnerabilities.”  The most severe of these flaws (CVE-2019-11127), a buffer overflow vulnerability in the NUC kit, has a CVSS score of 8.2 out of 10.

- Another high-severity flaw with a CVSS score of 8.2 out of 10 (CVE-2019-11128) stems from insufficient input validation in system firmware for Intel’s NUC Kit.

- Both flaws could also enable a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege, denial of service or information disclosure via local access.

## Telegram faces DDoS attack in China. – – again

-  Telegram faces DDoS attack in China… again  The popular encrypted messaging service Telegram is once again being hit with a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack in Asia as protestors in Hong Kong take to the streets.

- For the last several days, Hong Kong has been overrun with demonstrators protesting a new law that would put the municipality more directly under the control of mainland China’s authoritarian government.

- One of the tools that organizers have turned to is the encrypted messaging service, Telegram,  and other secure messaging technologies as they look to evade surveillance measures by government officials.

- Telegram first commented on the attack via Twitter roughly 17 hours ago in the late afternoon on Wednesday in Hong Kong.

- We’re currently experiencing a powerful DDoS attack, Telegram users in the Americas and some users from other countries may experience connection issues.

- — Telegram Messenger (@telegram) June 12, 2019  The company went on to describe a distributed denial of service attack as when “your servers get GADZILLIONS of garbage requests which stop them from processing legitimate requests.

- Imagine that an army of lemmings just jumped the queue at McDonald’s in front of you – and each is ordering a whopper,” according to Telegram.

- “The server is busy telling the whopper lemmings they came to the wrong place – but there are so many of them that the server can’t even see you to try and take your order.” This isn’t the first time that someone has tried to take down Telegram at a time when China was experiencing significant unrest.

## Notes on privacy and data collection of Matrix.org

- Notes on privacy and data collection of Matrix.org  DISCLAIMER: This research and investigation work is based on several years of experience within the Matrix ecosystem and validation of facts via public and private communication.

- Reverse engineering was used to ensure some of the statements presented as facts regarding implementations are accurate.

- Nonetheless it is possible that a mistake has made its way in these notes.

- If that is the case, please get in touch with the author which will fix any factual mistakes in good faith.

- We always encourage people not to trust statements at face value and always double-check for themselves.

- TL;DR: matrix.org and vector.im receive a lot of private, personal and identifiable data on a regular basis, or metadata that can be used to precisely identify and/or track users/server, their social graph, usage pattern and potential location.

- This is possible both by the default configuration values in synapse/Riot that do not promote privacy, and by specific choices made by their developers to not disclose, inform users or resolve in a timely manner several known behaviours of the software.

- Data sent on a potential regular basis based on a common web/desktop+smartphone usage even with a self-hosted client and Homeserver: The Matrix ID of users, usually including their username.

## No More LinkedIN

- 
It seems that after posting about an alleged sale of Iranian spy data on the darknet, I find myself no longer able to log into LinedIN.

- I believe someone reported me for that post and perhaps some of the other oddities posts I have found in the darknet and shared on my LI page.

- Upon trying to log in since then I get the following demand for my personal data, either my passport, my drivers license or some other identity card scanned or photographed to prove I am who I am to their site so I can log in again.

- I have a couple words for you LinkedIN; Fuck you.

- That’s right, fuck you.

- I remember when you got hacked and all your passwords were not encrypted.

- I sincerely doubt that you will handle even more sensitive data of mine like an image of my national ID, Passport, or my drivers license with any more delicacy.

- This also feels like just another means to gather even more data about me that you could potentially sell to others or provide to any law enforcement agency that asks in future.

## Security researcher finds critical XSS bug in Google's Invoice Submission Portal

-   A young Czech bug hunter has found a security flaw in one of Google's backend apps.

- If exploited by a malicious threat actor, the bug could have allowed hackers a way to steal Google employee cookies for internal apps and hijack accounts, launch extremely convincing spear-phishing attempts, and potentially gain access to other parts of Google's internal network.This attack vector was discovered by security researcher Thomas Orlita in February, this year, and has been patched in mid-April, but only now made public.XSS in Google's invoicing portalDescribed as a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, the security flaw impacted the Google Invoice Submission Portal, a public website where Google redirects business partners to submit invoices, based on contractual agreements.Most XSS flaws are considered benign, but there are those rare cases where these types of vulnerabilities can lead to serious consequences.One of those cases was Orlita's discovery.

- The researcher said that a malicious threat actor could have uploaded malformed files in the Google Invoice Submission Portal, via the Upload Invoice field.

- Using a proxy, the attacker could have intercepted the uploaded file immediately after the form submission and validation operation took place, and modified the documents from a PDF to HTML, to the XSS malicious payload.The data would have ended up being stored in Google's invoicing backend and would have executed automatically when an employee tried to view it.Google's internal network could have been at risk   "Since the XSS was executed on a googleplex.com subdomain while the employee is logged in, the attacker should be able to access the dashboard on this subdomain where it's possible to view and manage the invoices," Orlita told ZDNet via email.

> "Depending on the way cookies are configured on googleplex.com, it might also be possible to access other internal applications hosted on this domain," the researcher added.Since most Google internal apps are hosted on the googleplex.com domain, this opens the door for attackers to a wide range of possibilities.But, all in all, like most XSS security bugs, this bug would have depended on a threat actor's skill level and ability to pivot to more complex attacks.

> "The severity of the impact is, of course, depending on how well it can be exploited to access their internal sites," Orlita told ZDNet.

> "For example, an attacker might try a phishing attack on the employee.

> "For more technical details about the XSS bug, Orlita's official vulnerability disclosure is the place to go.More vulnerability reports:

## Julian Assange's Extradition Hearing Set For 2020

-  Julian Assange faces a long list of charges in the US.

- Getty Images WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will face an extradition hearing in February, a British judge ruled Friday.

- Assange is waiting to learn whether the UK will extradite him to the US, where he faces charges of conspiring to hack government computers.UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid approved the US Justice Department's request on Thursday, but it's up to the court to decide whether the extradition will go ahead.The US extradition request notes 18 charges related to endangering national security.

- Assange told the court that his life was "effectively at stake" if he is extradited, according to Bloomberg.

- He maintained that WikiLeaks is just a "publisher" and didn't break any laws to acquire information.Assange appeared via video link at a hearing at Westminster Magistrate's Court in London on Friday from Belmarsh Prison, where he's being held.

- Last month, the 47-year-old was sentenced to 50 weeks in jail in the UK for skipping bail in 2012.

- At the time, Sweden was attempting to extradite Assange on rape allegations.

- He retreated to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he claimed asylum and stayed there until police arrested him in April.

## JavaScript Template Attacks Expose New Browser Fingerprinting Vectors

-   Image: Schwarz et al.

- Academics have come up with a new technique that leaks data about users' browsers; enough to defeat anti-fingerprinting systems and privacy-preserving browser extensions to provide ways to identify users by their browser and underlying platform in a way that has not been done before.Called "JavaScript Template Attack," this new technique revolves around the concept of JavaScript properties and the default values that browser engines return for basic JavaScript queries seeking the value of a certain property.JavaScript environment templatesThe researchers, all three from the Graz University of Technology, in Austria, created a system that automates the querying and collection of thousands of JavaScript properties and their default values from a user's environment.The basic idea was to automate these queries and then rotate browsers, operating systems, hardware platform, and browser extensions, to collect the default values of all known JavaScript properties for each environment/installation.Researchers then built a matrix of each environment's default properties values, creating a template -- hence the name of JavaScript Template Attack -- for each possible detection scenario, listing all environment-dependent property values.

- The research team says these templates can be used at a later point to scan a visiting user and detect specific environment details based on the default property values the user's browser's returns.This data can be used for creating user profiles (for traffic/user fingerprinting) that break user anonymity or for devious means, like refining the targeting of zero-day exploits.A pretty powerful & accurate attack   The research team said tests showed their method was able to distinguish between all 40 tested environments; distinguish browser down to exact version; determine installed extensions based on how they modified native property values; determine even individual extension settings; determine extremely technical details such as the CPU vendor, actual operating system (not the one declared by user agents, which can be faked); determine the presence of a browser private mode; and even if the browser was running from within a virtual machine.This information might be useful for tracking or might be more useful for refining exploits.

- It all depends on what the threat actor is trying to do, but the conclusion is that the method is reliable enough to work and bypass even privacy-hardened environments, like Tor on Android.All in all, JavaScript Template Attacks turned out to be very powerful, as researchers also discovered a slew of JavaScript properties that had not been officially documented, which improved the accuracy of their method.

- Image: Schwarz et al.

- Furthermore, because browsers makers tend to improve their software with new Web APIs -- all of which are controllable via JavaScript -- the number of JavaScript properties has grown in the past years and is expected to grow, and improve the accuracy of JavaScript Template Attacks even more.

- Image: Schwarz et al.

- The research team said they hoped that browser makers and privacy extension developers use their work on uncovering environment-dependent differences between JavaScript property values to improve their products and stamp out any opportunities for user fingerprinting.Additional details about this research can be found in a white paper named "JavaScript Template Attacks: Automatically Inferring Host Information for Targeted Exploits," available for download from here and here.

## Vulnerabilities Expose BD Infusion Therapy Devices to Attacks

-  CyberMDX, a research and analysis company specializing in medical device security, on Thursday revealed that its employees identified two serious vulnerabilities in infusion therapy products from medical technology firm BD.

- The flaws affect the Alaris Gateway Workstation, which is used for mounting, powering and communicating with infusion pumps.

- Specifically, the weaknesses impact devices running versions 1.1.3, 1.2, 1.3.0 and 1.3.1 of the firmware.

- The latest versions, 1.3.2 and 1.6.1, are not impacted.

- Exploitation of the flaws could affect Alaris GS (no longer supported), GH, CC and TIVA infusion pumps running software version 2.3.6 and earlier.

- BD pointed out that version 2.3.6 was released back in 2006.

- One of the vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2019-10959 and classified as “critical” with a CVSS score of 10, allows an attacker with network access to the targeted device to upload a malicious firmware to the Alaris Gateway Workstation.

- The second security hole, tracked as CVE-2019-10962 and rated “high severity,” allows an attacker to access the web-based interface of the Alaris Gateway Workstation simply by knowing its IP address.

## Yubico YubiKey lets you be me: Security blunder sparks recall of govt-friendly auth tokens

-  Yubico is recalling one of its YubiKey lines after the authentication dongles were found to have a security weakness.

- The vendor said the firmware in the FIPS Series of YubiKey widgets, aimed mainly at US government use, were prone to a reduced-randomness condition that could make their cryptographic operations easier to crack in some cases, particularly when the USB-based token is first powered up.

- That could be exploited by a miscreant to potentially authenticate as someone else.

> "An issue exists in the YubiKey FIPS Series devices with firmware version 4.4.2 or 4.4.4 (there is no released firmware version 4.4.3) where random values leveraged in some YubiKey FIPS applications contain reduced randomness for the first operations performed after YubiKey FIPS power-up," Yubico said in announcing the recall today.

> "The buffer holding random values contains some predictable content left over from the FIPS power-up self-tests which could affect cryptographic operations which require random data until the predictable content is exhausted."

- Specifically, the recall covers the YubiKey FIPS, Nano FIPS, C FIPS, and C Nano FIPS models.

- The vulnerability was found to only exist in the FIPS Series of devices, so other YubiKey dongles are not affected by this particular blunder.

- Newer devices running version 4.4.5 of the firmware are protected and will not need to be replaced: the security shortcoming is present in firmware versions 4.4.2 and 4.4.4.

## Flaw in Alaris medical devices exposes infusion pumps to sabotage - SC Magazine

-  Medical tech company Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) has advised users of its Alaris Gateway Workstation – a smart connectivity and integration solution for infusion pump devices – to update their firmware, following the discovery of a highly critical remote code execution vulnerability.

- CyberMDX researcher Elad Luz found that multiple versions of the workstation – a tower upon which multiple infusion pumps can be mounted and docked – fail to prevent the upload of malicious files during a firmware update.

- An online vulnerability disclosure published by CyberMDX yesterday warns that affected devices could be exploited to accept counterfeit firmware updates “without any predicate authentication or permissions,” adding that such an attack “can be carried out by anyone who gains access to the hospital’s internal network.

- Files transferred via the update are copied straight to the internal memory and allowed to override existing files.” “An attack of this sort can allow an attacker to disable the workstation, disrupt the flow of electricity to care-critical infusion pumps, falsify pump status information (vital for the nursing staff), and in some cases even alter drug delivery,” wrote Jon Rabinowitz, VP marketing at CyberMDX, in a company blog post.

- Designated CVE-2019-10959, the vulnerability was assigned the highest possible CVSS v3 base score of 10.0, and was observed in Alaris Gateway Workstation versions 1.1.3 Build 10, 1.1.3 MR Build 11, 1.2 Build 15, 1.3.0 Build 14 and 1.3.1 Build 13.

- The GS, GH, CC and TIVA models of Alaris syringe pumps are also impacted if they use software versions 2.3.6 or below.

- These pumps were previously sold under the Asena brand.

- In its own June 13 vulnerability disclosure, BD asserts that a successful attack on a pump’s infusion parameters is a low-probability event because it depends on multiple prerequisites that collectively would be difficult to achieve.

## US Lawmakers Hear Testimony on Concerns of Deepfakes

- US Lawmakers Hear Testimony on Concerns of DeepfakesDays after a video of a transformed Arnold Swartzenegger went viral on YouTube, members of the US House Intelligence Committee heard testimony on Thursday, June 13, on raising concerns about the threat of  "deepfakes," according to The Hill.

- In his opening remarks, committee chairman Adam Schiff said, “Advances in AI and machine learning have led to the emergence of advanced digitally doctored media, so-called ‘deepfakes’ that allow malicious actors to foment chaos, division or crisis....Of great concern is that deepfakes could have the power to disrupt the democratic process, particularly the presidential race of 2020.”
Schiff noted that three years ago, lawmakers feared that falsified documents could be used to meddle in elections.

- “Three years later, we are on the cusp of a technological revolution that could enable even more sinister forms of deception.”
Of paramount concern is that foreign actors could use these deepfakes to spew misinformation through malicious campaigns intended to deceive the public or sway public opinion.

- Throughout the course of the more-than-two-hour hearing, the committee saw convincing examples of deepfakes and examples of synthetic pictures of people that don’t exist at all.

- Former FBI special agent and senior fellow for Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund Clint Watts was part of a four-person panel that testified before the lawmakers of the potential for foreign adversaries to craft synthetic media capabilities that could be used against the US.

- “The falsification of audio and video allows manipulators to dupe audience members in highly convincing ways, provoking emotional responses that can lead to widespread mistrust,” Watts warned.

- It’s not only lawmakers that are worried about the potential threat of deepfakes.

- In a June 13 blog post, Neiman Labs looked at myriad ways that deepfakes could be used to manipulate the outcome of an election, noting that “deepfakes have the potential to wreak havoc in contexts such as news, where audio and video are treated as a form of evidence that something actually happened.

## Google expands Android's built-in security key to iOS devices

-   Image: Google  In April, Google announced a groundbreaking technology that could allow Android users to use their smartphones as hardware security keys whenever logging into Google accounts on their laptops or work PCs.Initially, the technology was made available for Chrome OS, macOS, and Windows 10 devices.

- Today, Google announced it is expanding this technology to iOS as well.Today's news means that iPhone and iPad users can now use their (secondary) Android smartphones as a security key whenever logging into their Google accounts on an iOS device.The technology works basically the same, as Google explained in April, at the Cloud Next 2019 conference.To use it, users will have to have Bluetooth enabled on both their iOS and Android devices, so the Android smartphone can sign and authorize any login attempts for Google accounts initiated from the iOS counterpart.

- The only difference in the login mechanism, is who will be managing the login operations.

- On desktops and laptops, the Chrome browser is used to communicate with the Android phone's built-in security key over Bluetooth using FIDO's CTAP2 protocol.

- Because there's no actual Chrome browser on iOS (Chrome for iOS is actually running on WebKit -- aka a customized Safari), for iOS devices, the Chrome browser will be replaced by Google's Smart Lock app, which users will have to install on their iOS devices.

- If iOS users need help in setting up their Android smartphones as a security key for iOS devices, Google has some instructions in this blog post.Only Android smartphones running Android 7.0 (Nougat) or later support the built-in security key mechanism.Related cybersecurity coverage:

## Inside a Google Titan Bluetooth security key – high security, low durability

-  Google has been pushing its Titan two-factor authentication security keys as the best way to protect Google Accounts from hacking and phishing, especially high-value accounts that are regularly probed and attacked.

- The key is used as part of Google's Advanced Protection Program.Recently, a bug was discovered with the Bluetooth Titan key, and Google issued users replacements.

- Since I'm a Titan user, this meant that I had an old key to play with.

- So, what better use for it than to tear it apart.Must read: iOS 13: Things Apple still needs to fixSo, what is inside a Google Titan Bluetooth two-factor security key?Note: This teardown is for a Feitian Bluetooth two-factor security key, but Google's Titan keys are rebranded Feitian keys.Well, I have to admit that I was expecting a lot more than I saw.

- First off, the shell is constructed from cheap ABS plastic, with no reinforcement.

- I've only been using a Titan key for a few months, and I'd already noticed how in that time how roughed up it had become.

- For the teardown it split in two easily, and the circuit board fell out no problem.

- If you keep your security key on a keyring, then be aware that if it does break, the insides will fall out.

## nCipher Security Response to SSTIC HSM Security Vulnerability - Security Boulevard

-  Home » Security Bloggers Network » nCipher Security Response to SSTIC HSM Security Vulnerability  nCipher Security Response to SSTIC HSM Security Vulnerability   nCipher Security Response to SSTIC HSM Security Vulnerabilitydr-pali-surdharThu, 06/13/2019 – 22:20 Dear customers and partnersnCipher Security response to: Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!Security researchers from Ledger recently reported exploiting a hardware security module (HSM) attacked via the PKCS#11 interface.

- The presentation entitled ‘Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!‘ presented on June 5 at Symposium sur la sécurité des technologies de l’information et des communications (SSTIC) 2019 in Paris highlighted a number of security related issues that could be combined to perform a key extraction attack on a HSM.

- Although Thales/Gemalto has disclosed working with Ledger and remediated the reported issues on its vulnerable HSM products, some customers are understandably concerned that the attacks reported are generic and do not target a specific device.Based on our understanding of the presentation, nCipher Security has carried out investigations and determined that its products are not vulnerable to the attacks described for the following reasons:The nCipher nShield HSM only permits loading of cryptographically signed binaries and verifies signatures on loading.The firmware signature verification keys, loaded during the production process, are solely owned by nCipher and protected in offline HSM systems.Firmware upgrades are cryptographically secure and do not allow roll back to earlier versions with reported vulnerabilities.User loaded code can only execute within our patented secure execution environment, CodeSafe, that runs in isolation from the HSM core and kernel environment.Within CodeSafe it is not possible to execute user code on the HSM with root privileges or gain shell access in this environment.

- Debug facilities are also not available.We do not implement the Milenage algorithm that was shown to have multiple implementation flaws.Memory-safety issues are limited to the process hosting the PKCS#11 library.

- Our PKCS#11 library runs entirely on the host and translates API calls into nCore application programming interface (API) commands, sent via a serialized (marshalled) interface to the HSM.

- Extensive checking is performed during unmarshalling of commands.We do not implement a native PKCS#11 interface.

- nCore commands and access control list (ACL) policies are used to filter out weak mechanisms that allow for insecure and unsafe operations on keys.As part of Common Criteria EAL4+ evaluation, the firmware module undergoes external vulnerability testing, review of our secure development lifecycle, development environment and production processes.In summary, the attacks described by the researchers above are prevented on nCipher products by following a defence in depth approach that includes only permitting trusted firmware updates on our HSM.

- User loaded payloads are not permitted to execute with elevated privileges and remote attacks are prevented by validating inputs and by a secure implementation of the interface stack.The above activities demonstrate a mature security development lifecycle that mandates best practices including threat modelling, secure design, static and dynamic analysis, dedicated security code reviews, penetration testing, flaw remediation and vulnerability response, alongside operational and procedural controls that assure entire supply chain for the product.In addition to following best practices, nCipher places great emphasis on developing security-aware development teams and has a dedicated Security Office that puts product security first and foremost.Should you still have any questions or concerns please contact your account representative or local technical support team.Dr.

## Black Hat USA axes anti-abortion congressman as keynote speaker after outcry – and more news from infosec land

-  Roundup Here's a quick roundup of recent infosec news beyond what we've already reported.

- Black Hat USA cans planned keynote speaker following outcry  This year's Black Hat USA has axed keynote speaker US House rep Will Hurd (R-TX) after outcry over his politics and voting record.

- Attendees and presenters threatened to boycott the annual security conference due to the congressman's support for anti-abortion laws, efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, and unwillingness to back women in STEM, TechCrunch first reported.

- Given the much-needed push for more diversity and inclusion in the worlds of technology and information security, Hurd's invitation to speak at the event irked parts of the cyber-community.

- He is, for what it's worth, said to be one of the more tech-aware congresscritters in America.

- After 24 hours or less of pressure, Black Hat's organizers said in a statement to The Register on Friday that Hurd will not be lecturing security nerds in Vegas this year as planned:  Black Hat has chosen to remove U.S. Representative, Will Hurd, as our 2019 Black Hat USA Keynote.

- We misjudged the separation of technology and politics.

- We will continue to focus on technology and research, however we recognize that Black Hat USA is not the appropriate platform for the polarizing political debate resulting from our choice of speaker.

## XSS flaw would have allowed hackers access to Google’s network and impersonate its employees

- Bug hunter Thomas Orlita discovered an XSS vulnerability in Google’s Invoice Submission Portal that would have allowed attackers access to Google’s internal network
The Czech researcher Thomas Orlita discovered an XSS vulnerability in Google’s Invoice Submission Portal that would have allowed attackers access to part of Google’s internal network.

- The Google Invoice Submission Portal is a public portal used by Google’s business partners to submit invoices.

- An attacker could also exploit the flaw to steal Google employee cookies for internal apps and hijack accounts or send spear-phishing messages.

- The attack was devised by the expert in February, and Google addressed the issue in mid-April after the researcher reported it to the tech giant.

- Orlita explained that an attacker could have uploaded malformed files in the Google Invoice Submission Portal, via the Upload Invoice field.

- The expert noticed that the ‘upload’ feature for actual invoice in PDF format could be abused to upload HTML files.

- The attacker had to intercept a request and change the uploaded file’s filename and Content-Type properties to HTML.

- Using this trick it was possible to store malicious files in Google’s invoicing system and would have executed automatically when an employee tried to access it.

## Cellebrite claims it can unlock any iPhone, many new Android phones for police

- Not so long ago, companies that cracked personal devices on behalf of governments did so in secret, closely guarding even the descriptions of their capabilities.

- Now, it seems, they proudly tweet about their updated abilities to hack into new iPhones, like a videogame firm offering an expansion pack.On Friday afternoon, the Israeli forensics firm and law enforcement contractor Cellebrite publicly announced a new version of its product known as a Universal Forensic Extraction Device or UFED, one that it's calling UFED Premium.

- In marketing that update, it says that the tool can now unlock any iOS device cops can lay their hands on, including those running iOS 12.3, released just a month ago.

- Cellebrite claims UFED Premium can extract files from many recent Android phones as well, including the Samsung Galaxy S9.

- No other law enforcement contractor has made such broad claims about a single product, at least not publicly.

- The move signals not only another step in the cat and mouse game between smartphone makers and the government-sponsored firms that seek to defeat their security, but also a more unabashedly public phase of that security face-off.

> "Cellebrite is proud to introduce #UFED Premium!

- An exclusive solution for law enforcement to unlock and extract data from all iOS and high-end Android devices," the company wrote on its Twitter feed for the UFED product.

## Researchers use Rowhammer bit flips to steal 2048-bit crypto key

-  Enlarge / A DDR3 DIMM with error-correcting code from Samsung.

- ECC is no longer an absolute defense against Rowhammer attacks.

- 55  with 48 posters participating, including story author  The Rowhammer exploit that lets unprivileged attackers corrupt or change data stored in vulnerable memory chips has evolved over the past four years to take on a range of malicious capabilities, including elevating system rights and breaking out of security sandboxes, rooting Android phones, and taking control of supposedly impregnable virtual machines.

- Now, researchers are unveiling a new attack that uses Rowhammer to extract cryptographic keys or other secrets stored in vulnerable DRAM modules.

- Like the previous Rowhammer-based attacks, the new data-pilfering RAMBleed technique exploits the ever-shrinking dimensions of DRAM chips that store data a computer needs to carry out various tasks.

- Rowhammer attacks work by rapidly accessing—or hammering—physical rows inside vulnerable chips in ways that cause bits in neighboring rows to flip, meaning 1s turn to 0s and vice versa.

- The attacks work because as capacitors become closer together, they more quickly leak the electrical charges that store the bits.

- At one time, these bit flips were little more than an exotic crashing phenomenon that was known to be triggered only by cosmic rays.

## Google Chrome Canary Flag Makes The Browser a Colorful Mess

-   Google is testing a new feature in the Chrome Canary builds that allows you to change the colors used by various user interface elements of the browser.

- This allows users to make the browser and its New Tab Page a colorful mess that some may find amusing, while others find painful.

- In current versions of Google Chrome you already have the ability to change the background on the New Tab Page to solid colors, an uploaded image, or a variety of backgrounds offered by Google.

- Two new flags in the Chrome Canary build now also allow you to change the colors of open tabs, the address bar, and other user interface elements of the browser using the new "NTP customization menu version 2".

- This let's you create a colorful, but quite ugly, browser window like the one below.

- Customized Chrome New Tab Page To enable this feature, download Chrome Canary and go to the chrome://flags screen.

## SACK Panic – Multiple TCP-based remote denial-of-service issues (redhat.com)

- Executive SummaryThree related flaws were found in the Linux kernel’s handling of TCP networking.

- The most severe vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to trigger a kernel panic in systems running the affected software and, as a result, impact the system’s availability.The issues have been assigned multiple CVEs: CVE-2019-11477 is considered an Important severity, whereas CVE-2019-11478 and CVE-2019-11479 are considered a Moderate severity.

- The first two are related to the Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) packets combined with Maximum Segment Size (MSS), the third solely with the Maximum Segment Size (MSS).These issues are corrected either through applying mitigations or kernel patches.

- Mitigation details and links to RHSA advsories can be found on the RESOLVE tab of this article.Issue Details and BackgroundThree related flaws were found in the Linux kernel’s handling of TCP Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) packets handling with low MSS size.

- The extent of impact is understood to be limited to denial of service at this time.

- No privilege escalation or information leak is currently suspected.While mitigations shown in this article are available, they might affect traffic from legitimate sources that require the lower MSS values to transmit correctly and system performance.

- Please evaluate the mitigation that is appropriate for the system’s environment before applying.What is a selective acknowledgement ?TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) is a mechanism where the data receiver can inform the sender about all the segments that have successfully been accepted.

- This allows the sender to retransmit segments of the stream that are missing from its ‘known good’ set.

## The CIA Spied on People Through Their Smart TVs, Leaked Documents Reveal (2017) (vice.com)

-  Hackers at the Central Intelligence Agency, with the help of colleagues from the British spy agency MI5, developed malware to secretly spy on targets through their Samsung Smart TVs, according to new documents published by WikiLeaks.

- On Tuesday, WikiLeaks dumped a large cache of documents allegedly coming from the CIA's hacking unit.

- Julian Assange's organization dubbed the release, which it says it's the first in a series, as "Vault 7," and billed it as the largest-ever of confidential CIA intelligence documents.

> "Weeping Angel already hooks key presses [...] to cause the system to enter Fake-Off rather than Off."

- The CIA and MI5 called the project to spy on Samsung Smart TVs "Weeping Angel," perhaps a reference to Doctor Who, where weeping angels are "the deadliest, most powerful, most malevolent life-form ever produced."

- The malware was designed to keep the smart TVs on even when they were turned off.

- This was dubbed "Fake-Off mode," according to the documents.

- The CIA hackers even developed a way to "suppress" the TVs LED indicators to improve the "Fake-Off" mode.

## Samsung TVs should be regularly virus-checked, the company says (bbc.co.uk)

-   Image copyright Getty Images  Image caption  Samsung issued the safety advice to owners of its QLED-branded TVs  Samsung has advised owners of its latest TVs to run regular virus scans.A how-to video on the Samsung Support USA Twitter account demonstrates the more than a dozen remote-control button presses required to access the sub-menu needed to activate the check.It suggested users should carry out the process "every few weeks" to "prevent malicious software attacks".The suggestion surprised cyber-security specialists, who said the public would be unlikely to go to the trouble.BBC News asked Samsung whether any specific threat had prompted the warning.

- Image copyright Twitter  The company responded that it had been "posted for customers' education".

- However, it also deleted the post at about the same time.

- The 19-second video guide had been watched more than 200,000 times.

- 'Pointless advice'Samsung's recent smart TVs run off a version of its proprietary operating system, Tizen, and often come pre-loaded with McAfee's Security for TV anti-virus software.One security adviser had described the tweet as being "pointless advice" that would be a "waste of time" to follow.

> "There is a tiny number of known malware that might attack a TV," said Ken Munro, of Pen Test Partners.

> "I've seen one case of a ransomware infection but the prospect of it happening to most users is very small.

> "A better solution would be for Samsung to automatically update its operating system for you.

## Cloudflare launches decentralized service for generating random numbers

-   Image: Cloudflare, League of Entropy  Today, Cloudflare announced the launch of a new public service called League of Entropy that will generate a stream of random numbers, which companies, government agencies, or lone developers can use as random input inside their applications.The service might sound silly for a non-technical user, but random numbers are more important than most people think.Random numbers are at the heart of modern cryptography, and having access to a source of randomness is crucial for the security of all our apps.A predictable source of random numbers can compromise an application by allowing threat actors to mathematically determine cryptographic keys and passwords that have been generated for users, or at specific times.For example, in the early 2010s, an Iowa man orchestrated one of the most complex heists of a public lottery in US history by tampering with a randomness beacon's algorithm that generated random numbers, allowing him to determine the winning numbers at precise times in the future.

- Having the ability to access a secure random number beacon is crucial for the development of any secure application.

- Most software usually relies on the underlying device to provide this source of randomness, may it be an Android smartphone or something advanced such as a Linux server.However, single-sourced beacons of entropy are dangerous, as devices can be compromised and the randomness source manipulated.The League of Entropy is born   In the past, there have been efforts to launch and run distributed sources of randomness, all with various degrees of success.Today, Cloudflare and its partners announced the launch of League of Entropy, a five-server network that will generate and make available secure streams of random numbers.All five servers will generate their own part of a larger stream of random numbers and pool it together on a public service, available to everyone.

> "This global network of servers generating randomness ensures that even if a few servers are offline, the beacon continues to produce new numbers by using the remaining online servers," Cloudflare said today.

> "Even if one or two of the servers or their entropy sources were to be compromised, the rest will still ensure that the jointly-produced entropy is fully unpredictable and unbiasable.

> "Five servers located across the globeParticipating in this project are Cloudflare, Protocol Labs researcher Nicolas Gailly, University of Chile, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), and Kudelski Security.The five organizations will run five servers, all with very different sources of entropy -- ranging from lava lamps to seismic shakes -- to form the collective League of Entropy network.At launch-time, the League of Entropy service will be formed by:Cloudflare's LavaRand: LavaRand sources her high entropy from Cloudflare's wall of lava lamps at our San Francisco Headquarters.

- The unpredictable flow of "lava" inside the lamps is used as an input to a camera feed into a CSPRNG (Cryptographically Secure PseudoRandom Number Generator) that generates the random value.EPFL's URand: URand's power comes from the local randomness generator present on every computer at /dev/urandom.

- The randomness input is collected from inputs such as keyboard presses, mouse clicks, network traffic, etc.

## Spin the wheel and find today's leaky cloud DB... *clack clack... clack* A huge trove of medical malpractice complaints

-  In what has become a depressingly common occurrence, the personal information of hundreds of thousands of people may have fallen into the wrong hands because yet another organization did not secure a cloud-hosted database.

- This time around, social media marketing house xSocialMedia has been accused of failing to set up proper protections on multiple databases tracking the activity of advertising campaigns for medical malpractice lawyers.

- That configuration blunder seemingly left the data silos facing the public internet for anyone to find and rifle through.

- Researchers at vpnMentor, who specialize in discovering and documenting insecure cloud servers, say they were able to get into xSocialMedia's databases and view the personal information of people who had clicked on ads on Facebook for legal advice or class action claims for things like botched surgeries and defective implants.

- Because of the nature of the campaigns, the biz tended to gather particularly sensitive information from netizens clicking through the promotions.

- The database of collected information, containing some 150,000 records, included things like names, addresses, phone numbers, and partial medical history.

> "The ads that xSocialMedia post on Facebook lead users to a variety of 'injury-check.com' domains, depending on their specific ailments.

- Examples include ied-fund.injury-check.com and ivcfilter-risk.injury-check.com," staff at vpnMentor explained.

## Google to Reimplement Curl in Libcrurl

-  Not the entire thing, just “a subset”.

- It’s not stated very clearly exactly what that subset is but the easy interface is mentioned in the Chrome bug about this project.

- What?

- The Chromium bug states that they will create a library of their own (named libcrurl) that will offer (parts of) the libcurl API and be implemented using Cronet.

- Cronet is the networking stack of Chromium put into a library for use on mobile.

- The same networking stack that is used in the Chrome browser.

- There’s also a mentioned possibility that “if this works”, they might also create “crurl” tool which is then their own version of the curl tool but using their own library.

- In itself is a pretty strong indication that their API will not be fully compatible, as if it was they could just use the existing curl tool… Why?

## Presidential alerts can be easily spoofed, thanks to LTE security vulnerabilities

-      Last year, the United States performed the first public test of the national Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA), an alert system designed to send messages to smartphones, TVs, and other systems simultaneously.

- The test was specifically for the 'Presidential Alert,' a new category that can't be opted out of (like AMBER alerts).

- It turns out these types of alerts can be easily spoofed, thanks to various security vulnerabilities with LTE towers.

- A group of researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder released a paper that details how Presidential Alerts can be faked.

- An attack using a commercially-available radio and various open-source software tools can create an alert with a custom message.

- Researchers were able to use just four malicious portable stations to cover a 50,000 seat stadium with a 90% success rate: Our attack can be performed using a commercially-available software defined radio, and our modifications to the open source NextEPC and srsLTE software libraries.

- We find that with only four malicious portable base stations of a single Watt of transmit power each, almost all of a 50,000-seat stadium can be attacked with a 90% success rate.

- The true impact of such an attack would of course depend on the density of cell phones in range; fake alerts in crowded cities or stadiums could potentially result in cascades of panic.

## How Verizon and a BGP Optimizer Knocked Large Parts of the Internet Offline Today

-  Massive route leak impacts major parts of the Internet, including CloudflareWhat happened?Today at 10:30UTC, the Internet had a small heart attack.

- A small company in Northern Pennsylvania became a preferred path of many Internet routes through Verizon (AS701), a major Internet transit provider.

- This was the equivalent of Waze routing an entire freeway down a neighborhood street — resulting in many websites on Cloudflare, and many other providers, to be unavailable from large parts of the Internet.

- This should never have happened because Verizon should never have forwarded those routes to the rest of the Internet.

- To understand why, read on.We have blogged about these unfortunate events in the past, as they are not uncommon.

- This time, the damage was seen worldwide.

- What exacerbated the problem today was the involvement of a “BGP Optimizer” product from Noction.

- This product has a feature that splits up received IP prefixes into smaller, contributing parts (called more-specifics).

## Confirmed: NASA Has Been Hacked

-  The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) this week confirmed that its Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has been hacked.

- An audit document from the U.S. Office of the Inspector General was published by NASA this week.

- It reveals that an unauthorized Raspberry Pi computer connected to the JPL servers was targeted by hackers, who then moved laterally further into the NASA network.

- How much further?

- Well, the hackers apparently got as far as the Deep Space Network (DSN) array of radio telescopes and numerous other JPL systems.

- The extent of the breach, which happened in April 2018, was such that the Johnson Space Center, with responsibility for programs including the International Space Station, decided to disconnect from the gateway altogether.

- The audit report states that, "Johnson officials were concerned the cyber attackers could move laterally from the gateway into their mission systems, potentially gaining access and initiating malicious signals to human space flight missions that use those systems."

- If that sounds pretty serious stuff, it's because it is.

-  Hackers infiltrated the networks of at least ten cellular telcos around the world, and remained hidden for years, as part of a long-running tightly targeted surveillance operation, The Register has learned.

- This espionage campaign is still ongoing, it is claimed.

- Cyber-spy hunters at US security firm Cybereason told El Reg on Monday the miscreants responsible for the intrusions were, judging from their malware and skills, either part of the infamous Beijing-backed hacking crew dubbed APT10 – or someone operating just like them, perhaps deliberately so.

- Whoever it was, the snoops apparently spent the past two or more years inside ten-plus cellphone networks dotted around the planet.

- In some cases, we're told, the hackers were able to deploy their own VPN services on the telcos' infrastructure to gain quick, persistent, and direct access to the carriers rather than hop through compromised internal servers and workstations.

- These VPN services were not detected by the telcos' IT staff.

> "It is straight up brazen," Cybereason principal security researcher Amit Serper told El Reg hours earlier.

> "They figured out there was a lot of lag in using hacked machines, and said: let's install a VPN and get it over with.

## Verizon and a BGP Optimizer Knocked Large Parts of the Internet Offline (cloudflare.com)

-  Massive route leak impacts major parts of the Internet, including CloudflareWhat happened?Today at 10:30UTC, the Internet had a small heart attack.

- A small company in Northern Pennsylvania became a preferred path of many Internet routes through Verizon (AS701), a major Internet transit provider.

- This was the equivalent of Waze routing an entire freeway down a neighborhood street — resulting in many websites on Cloudflare, and many other providers, to be unavailable from large parts of the Internet.

- This should never have happened because Verizon should never have forwarded those routes to the rest of the Internet.

- To understand why, read on.We have blogged about these unfortunate events in the past, as they are not uncommon.

- This time, the damage was seen worldwide.

- What exacerbated the problem today was the involvement of a “BGP Optimizer” product from Noction.

- This product has a feature that splits up received IP prefixes into smaller, contributing parts (called more-specifics).

## Iran is doing to our networks what it did to our spy drone, claims Uncle Sam: Now they're bombing our hard drives

-  Hackers operating on behalf of the Iranian government have turned destructive, the US Department of Homeland Security has claimed.

- A statement issued over the weekend by Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) director Christopher Krebs describes how Tehran-backed miscreants have gone from simply attempting to harvest blueprints, sensitive data, and account credentials from American systems, to actively working to wipe clean Uncle Sam's PCs, servers, and network infrastructure in their wake.

- The attackers are, it is claimed, targeting the IT infrastructures of US government agencies and their private-sector contractors.

- While cyber-raids by Iran are nothing new, the aggressive deleting of data from hard drives and other storage gear is apparently cause for concern.

- We're not at all surprised by it.

- Rather than covertly and silently snooping on Western computers, Iranian hackers are, we're told, just going for broke and making their presence known loud and clear, by trashing file systems, and thus sending a message to the White House.

> "Iranian regime actors and proxies are increasingly using destructive ‘wiper’ attacks, looking to do much more than just steal data and money.

- These efforts are often enabled through common tactics like spear phishing, password spraying, and credential stuffing," Krebs warned.

## Firefox zero-day was used in attack against Coinbase employees, not its users (zdnet.com)

-   Logo: Coinbase // Composition: ZDNet  A recent Firefox zero-day that has made headlines across the tech news world this week was actually used in attacks against Coinbase employees, and not the company's users, ZDNet has learned.Furthermore, the attacks used not one, but two Firefox zero-days, according to Philip Martin, a member of the Coinbase security team, which reported the attacks to Mozilla.

> "On Monday, Coinbase detected & blocked an attempt by an attacker to leverage the reported 0-day, along with a separate 0-day Firefox sandbox escape, to target Coinbase employees," Martin said.

> "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark"Mozilla issued a patch following the Coinbase team's notification, a patch for which it also credited Samuel Groß, a security researcher with Google Project Zero security team.Asked to comment on the Firefox zero-day earlier this week, Groß said he reported a bug in Firefox to Mozilla back on April 15.

- Groß said the bug would have allowed a remote attacker to execute code inside a victim's browser, but that the attacker would have needed a separate sandbox escape bug to run code on the underlying OS.It appears that two months after Groß reported this bug to Mozilla via the organization's private Bugzilla bug tracker, the bug was exploited in live attacks, along with a sandbox escape.

- It is unclear how the Coinbase attackers got hold of this RCE bug's details to use it for their attacks.

- Several scenarios come to mind:- the attackers discovered the same RCE bug on their own- they obtained the info from an insider with access to Mozilla's security bugs portal- they compromised a Mozilla employee's account and accessed the Bugzilla portal's security section- or, they hacked the Bugzilla portal, similar to an incident from 2015Attackers targeted Coinbase and other cryptocurrency orgsFortunately, the two Firefox bugs, which were chained into one single exploit and deployed against Coinbase employees, was detected by Coinbase staffers.If successful, a hacker could have gained access to the Coinbase backend network and used this access to steal funds from the exchange -- a tactic that has been used numerous times in the past and has led to gigantic losses at many cryptocurrency exchanges before.

> "We walked back the entire attack, recovered and reported the 0-day to Firefox, pulled apart the malware and [infrastructure] used in the attack, and are working with various orgs to continue burning down [the] attacker's infrastructure and digging into the attacker involved," Martin said.

> "We've seen no evidence of exploitation targeting customers," Martin said, also adding that other cryptocurrency-linked organizations have also been targeted by this group.

## Millions of Windows Dell PCs need patching: Give-me-admin security gremlin found lurking in bundled support tool

-  Millions of Windows Dell PCs need patching: Give-me-admin security gremlin found lurking in bundled support tool Can't spell SupportAssist without 'ass' and 'u' – other makers may be hit, too Oh, bloody Dell ... CEO Big Mike   Updated Dell's troubleshooting software SupportAssist, bundled with the US tech titan's home and business computers, has a security flaw that can be exploited by malware and rogue logged-in users to gain administrator powers.

- The Texan system slinger today issued an advisory warning that its PC repair tool suffers a privilege-escalation vulnerability, CVE-2019-12280, and needs patching.

- We're told Dell SupportAssist for Business PCs version 2.0.1 and Dell SupportAssist for Home PCs version 3.2.2 are the builds you need to fetch and install to kill off this high-severity hole.

- Affected versions of the software include Dell SupportAssist for Business PCs version 2.0, and Dell SupportAssist for Home PCs version 3.2.1 and all prior releases.

- The IT giant includes the Windows-based troubleshooting program with new desktops, notebooks, and tablets.

- Unfortunately, as eggheads at SafeBreach Labs discovered and privately reported, the software insecurely loads .dll files when run.

- Researcher Peleg Hadar told The Register SupportAssist, which runs with SYSTEM-level privileges, will automatically pull in unsigned code libraries from user-controlled folders.

- That means malware or dodgy users can leave their own .dll files in a path, wait for SupportAssist to blindly load them, and thus execute code within an admin context.

## Anonymous Hacker Exposed After Dropping USB Drive While Throwing Molotov Cocktail

-   In a bizarre investigation, Belgium police have identified a member of the Anonymous Belgium hacker collective while investigating an arson case at a local bank.The perpetrator, a 35-year-old man from the Belgian city of Roeselare, was initially arrested after throwing a Molotov cocktail at the Crelan Bank office in Rumbeke, a suburb of Roeselare, back in 2014.Police tracked down the suspect because he dropped a USB thumb drive on the ground while/after throwing the Molotov cocktail.Data on the thumb drive led police to a local man identified in court documents only by Brecht S..Lost USB thumb drive leads police to Anonymous hackerA subsequent house search and investigation into the man's background and computer devices revealed a long history of cyber-crimes.

- They said that in addition to throwing a Molotov cocktail at a Crelan Bank office, Brecht also launched DDoS attacks against Crelan's e-banking portal, bringing the site down for hours on numerous ocassions.In court, Brecht said he attacked the bank because Crelan officials refused to meet with him following the disappearance of €300,000 ($342,000) from his mother's bank account following the divorce from his father.

- He justified the attacks as revenge for his mother's financial losses.

- The man's penchant for launching DDoS attacks wasn't an isolated case, though, according to the prosecution.Belgian police said the man was also an active member of the Anonymous Belgium and Cyber Crew hacking groups, participating in some of their past operations, including one aimed at FIFA, the international soccer/football federation.Brecht also orchestrated DDoS extortions, with one aimed at an unnamed pizza restaurant.

- Investigators said the suspect attacked and brought down the restaurant's website with DDoS attacks on numerous occasions, and asked for a ransom payment to stop his attacks.Police also track down co-conspiratorThe investigation into Brecht also exposed a co-conspirator -- a 44-year-old man from Bruges, with whom Brecht had exchanged hacking tools in the past via Facebook.According to Belgian news site Het Laatste Nieuws, the two were involved in many other cyber-attacks, but investigators couldn't pin or confirm some of these incidents because Facebook refused to cooperate in the investigation.HLN reported last week that Brecht received an 18 months prison sentence for his cyber-crimes, and was ordered to pay €3,000 ($3,400) to Crelan Bank as compensation for the e-banking portal's downtime.Brecht's recent jail term will be added on top of a three-year prison sentence for arson (related to throwing the Molotov cocktail).

- The first sentence's execution was delayed so Brecht could receive counseling for psychological problems.Brecht's co-conspirator, the 44-year-old man from Brugge, was let off without a prison sentence, being ordered to pay a €1,200 ($1,370) fine.Related malware and cybercrime coverage:

## Vulnerabilities Surface as Kubernetes is Upgraded - EnterpriseAI

-  Vulnerabilities Surface as Kubernetes is Upgraded     via Shutterstock  The second release this year of the upgraded Kubernetes cluster orchestrator includes no less than 26 enhancements, including three deemed to be “stable.” Meanwhile, another security issue has turned up in a Kubernetes interface used to run commands against Kubernetes clusters.

- Community leaders noted that the latest Kubernetes upgrade focuses on easing installation, configuring and upgrading the cluster orchestrator widely used to deliver applications and other micro-services.

- For example, a tool called kubeadm graduated to beta, enabling users to become more familiar with configuring and deploying so-called “high-availability” clusters.

- The new version also delivers greater functionality for the Kubernetes container storage interface, including a new capability called “volume cloning” that can be used when provisioning a new storage volume.

- As Kubernetes gains traction as an enterprise de facto standard, project managers stressed the latest release also looks beyond new features to unsure greater stability.

- Kubernetes developers “have been working on improving test coverage, ensuring the basics stay reliable and stability of the core feature set and working on maturing existing features and cleaning up the backlog,” the group said in a blog post.

- Kubernetes 1.15 is available for download on GitHub.

- The exploding Kubernetes community recommends using the kubeadm tool, defined as a “lifecycle building block,” to launch an initial production Kubernetes cluster conforming with best practices.

## Botnet Uses SSH and ADB to Create Android Cryptomining Army

-   Researchers discovered a cryptocurrency mining botnet that uses the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) Wi-Fi interface and SSH connections to hosts stored in the known_hosts list to spread to other devices.

- While the ADB is disabled on most Android devices by default, some ship with it enabled allowing unauthenticated attackers to connect remotely via the 5555 TCP port, providing direct access via the ADB command shell which is commonly used by developers to install and debug apps.

- The botnet is active in "21 different countries, with the highest percentage found in South Korea" according to Trend Micro's cyber threat researcher Jindrich Karasek, with Shodan having returned 13,577 Internet-connected potential targets with the ADB debugging interface enabled.

- At the beginning of the infection process, the malware will connect to devices where the ADB interface is reachable and it will immediately "change the attacked system’s working directory to /data/local/tmp" to take advantage of all files being saved in that folder receiving permission to execute by default.

- Dropping the cryptominer payload Next, the malicious implant will check if it has landed on a honeypot and the type of system it managed to infiltrate to be able to download a malware dropper script payload using wget or curl from an attacker-controlled server in the form of a Bash script named a.sh.

- After being launched on the infected device, the dropper will be immediately be removed to erase any infection traces and evade detection.

- A miner payload will be downloaded after checking the system's architecture with the dropper having the option to "choose from three different downloadable miners."

- Miner dropper script As is customary these days, competing malicious cryptocurrency miners are also targeted by the bot with their processes being terminated and their Internet access blocked by altering the /etc/hosts file, redirecting all connections to the 0.0.0.0 non-routable address.

## Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency is big news but will it be secure?

-  Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ll know that earlier this week Facebook announced plans for a new global cryptocurrency for absolutely everyone called Libra.

- Slated to launch in 2020, Libra’s success will be decided by the interaction of three things – its financial architecture (which is complex and novel), how this affects its popularity and take up, and the consequences of how it might be used and misused.

- Financial design Regardless of what you think of the idea of a cryptocurrency invented (but not controlled) by Facebook, Libra’s coming feels like a big moment for an idea that’s been around for a decade but is still struggling to become mainstream.

- Bitcoin, for instance, is a world-famous cryptocurrency almost nobody uses to do real economic work beyond consuming lots of electricity mining tokens and then speculating emptily on their value.

- Libra thinks it can solve this by being more like a real fiat currency, managed by big brands (Visa, Mastercard, Spotify, PayPal, Uber, Lyft, Vodafone, and Facebook itself), backed by real assets, and regulated to avoid both volatility and the possibility of money laundering.

- As Libra’s 29-page white paper states: The Libra Blockchain is a decentralized, programmable database designed to support a low-volatility cryptocurrency that will have the ability to serve as an efficient medium of exchange for billions of people around the world.

- Far from trying to disrupt central control, Libra will embrace it whilst fulfilling the big economic promise of cryptocurrencies to abolish the archaically high charges levied to move currencies around or translate them from one (the dollar, say) to another (the euro or Renminbi).

- Libra does employ one innovation for a cryptocurrency on this scale by splitting itself into two parts, the fiat-backed currency and a second investment token that will be offered to accredited investors and members of the Libra Association.

## New Silex malware is bricking IoT devices, has scary plans | ZDNet

-   A new strain of malware is wiping the firmware of IoT devices in attacks reminiscent of the old BrickerBot malware that destroyed millions of devices back in 2017.Named Silex, this malware began operating earlier today, about three-four hours before this article's publication.The malware had bricked around 350 devices when this reporter began investigating its operations, and the number quickly spiked to 2,000 wiped devices by the time we published, an hour later.Attacks are still ongoing, and according to an interview with the malware's creator, they are about to intensify in the coming days.How the Silex malware worksAccording to Akamai researcher Larry Cashdollar, who first spotted the malware earlier today, Silex works by trashing an IoT device's storage, dropping firewall rules, removing the network configuration, and then halting the device.

- It's as destructive as it can get without actually frying the IoT device's circuits.

- To recover, victims must manually reinstall the device's firmware, a task too complicated for the majority of device owners.It's expected that some owners will most likely throw devices away, thinking they've had a hardware failure without knowing that they've been hit by malware.

- Image: Larry Cashdollar   "It's using known default credentials for IoT devices to log in and kill the system," Cashdollar told ZDNet in an email today.

> "It's doing this by writing random data from /dev/random to any mounted storage it finds.

> "I see in the binary it's calling fdisk -l which will list all disk partitions," Cashdollar added.

> "It then writes random data from /dev/random to any partitions it discovers.

> ""It's then deleting network configurations, [...] also, it's [running] rm -rf / which will delete anything it has missed.

## Vulnerability in AMD’s Secure Encrypted Virtualization for EPYC: Update Now to Build 22

-  One of the key elements of building a processor is that designing a secure product involves reducing the ‘attack surface’ as much as possible: the fewer ways an attack can get in, the safer your product is.

- For the white knights of the security world, when a vulnerability is found, the process usually goes through a period of reasonable disclosure, i.e.

- the issue is presented to the company, and they are often given a certain time to fix the issue (to help customers) before the full disclosure is made public (in case it might be swept under the rug).

- Using this method, a researcher at Google found a vulnerability in the way AMD’s EPYC processors provide Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) which would allow an attacker to recover a secure key that would provide access between previously isolated VMs on a system.

- AMD has since released an update to the firmware which patches this issue.

- AMD’s Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) feature on its EPYC processors allows a system that runs multiple virtual machines through a hypervisor to have those virtual machines purely isolated from one another.

- By producing encryption keys at the hardware level, the hypervisor can maintain the equivalent of separate secure enclaves between VMs with individual keys.

- The SEV code runs deep within the EPYC processor, specifically on a Platform Security Processor (PSP), which is a hardened ARM Cortex core.

- Goss rebroadcasts them from a radio device perched on his roof, in case the neighbors care to tune in.

- There’s nothing wrong with Goss’ terrestrial internet connection, he assures me—Kingman is not that remote.

- But if bitcoin is truly digital gold, as he believes, contingencies are important.

- If the internet goes down, how else will you access your cache?Gregory Barber covers cryptocurrency, blockchain, and artificial intelligence for WIRED.For some, the trouble with bitcoin, the internet’s native currency, is the internet.

## New Cisco critical bugs: 9.8/10-severity Nexus security flaws need urgent update | ZDNet

- New Cisco critical bugs: 9.8/10-severity Nexus security flaws need urgent update Admins using Cisco's automation software or Nexus kit should patch now.

- Cisco: DNS attacks will undermine trust in the internet  Cisco has revealed two more highly critical security bugs affecting its data-center software, a week after telling customers to patch core network-management products.

- The newly disclosed bugs affect Cisco's Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) software and once again are in its web-based management interface.

- Both flaws can be exploited by anyone on the internet and are rated as critical, with severity ratings of 9.8 out of 10.

- DCNM is the network management system for all NX-OS systems that use Cisco's Nexus hardware in data centers.

- The software is used to automate provisioning, troubleshooting, and spotting configuration errors.

- In other words, it's a crucial piece of software for organizations that use Nexus switches, whose NX-OS operating system got patches for an equally severe flaw in May.

- The first issue, CVE-2019-1619, is an authentication bypass in DCNM's web interface that allows an attacker to take a valid session cookie without knowing the admin user password.

## Exclusive: Western intelligence hacked 'Russia's Google' Yandex to...

- WASHINGTON/LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Hackers working for Western intelligence agencies broke into Russian internet search company Yandex (YNDX.O) in late 2018 deploying a rare type of malware in an attempt to spy on user accounts, four people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

- FILE PHOTO: The logo of Russian internet group Yandex is pictured at the company's headquarter in Moscow, Russia October 4, 2018.

- REUTERS/Shamil Zhumatov/File PhotoThe malware, called Regin, is known to be used by the “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance of the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the sources said.

- Intelligence agencies in those countries declined to comment.

- Western cyberattacks against Russia are seldom acknowledged or spoken about in public.

- It could not be determined which of the five countries was behind the attack on Yandex, said sources in Russia and elsewhere, three of whom had direct knowledge of the hack.

- The breach took place between October and November 2018.

- Yandex spokesman Ilya Grabovsky acknowledged the incident in a statement to Reuters, but declined to provide further details.

## NSA Improperly Collected U.S. Phone Records a Second Time (usatoday.com)

- CLOSEThe National Security Administration campus in Fort Meade, Md.

- (Photo: Patrick Semansky, AP)The National Security Agency improperly collected phone call records of Americans last fall, months after a previous breach that compelled the agency to destroy millions of records from the contentious program, documents released Wednesday revealed.The redacted documents, obtained by the ACLU in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, do not indicate how many records NSA improperly collected in the October breach, nor which telecommunications provider submitted the improper data.

> "These documents provide further evidence that the NSA has consistently been unable to operate the call detail record program within the bounds of the law," the ACLU said in a letter to Congress this week lobbying for an end to the program.

- The letter says elements within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence concluded the October violations had a "significant impact" on privacy and civil rights, but that the Americans affected were not told of the breach.

- The program burst into the international spotlight in 2013, when renegade NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked information on U.S. surveillance techniques.

- Federal courts subsequently rejected the mass collection of American phone records, but Congress then passed the USA Freedom Act, which allows the collection with limits.Patrick Toomey, a staff attorney with the ACLU’s National Security Project, said there is "no justification" for continuing to provide such powers to the NSA.Massive breach: Ex-NSA contractor pleads guilty to hoarding information“These documents further confirm that this surveillance program is beyond redemption and a privacy and civil liberties disaster,” Toomey said in a statement.

- “The NSA’s collection of Americans’ call records is too sweeping, the compliance problems too many and evidence of the program’s value all but nonexistent.

> "The program collects call records but does not include content of the calls.

## 2001: Linux is cancer, says Microsoft. 2019: Hey friends, ah, can we join the official linux-distros mailing list, plz?

-  Microsoft's transformation into a fully paid-up member of the Linux love-train continued this week as the Windows giant sought to join the exclusive club that is the official linux-distros mailing list.

- The purpose of the linux-distros list is used by Linux distributions to privately report, coordinate, and discuss security issues yet to reach the general public; oss-security is there for stuff that is already out in the open or cannot wait for things to bounce around for a few days first.

- Sasha Levin, who describes himself as a "Linux kernel hacker" at the beast of Redmond, made the application for his employer to join the list, which if approved would allow Microsoft to tap into private behind-the-scenes chatter about vulnerabilities, patches, and ongoing security issues with the open-source kernel and related code.

- These discussions are crucial for getting an early heads up, and coordinating the handling and deployment of fixes before they are made public.

- To demonstrate that Microsoft qualifies for membership alongside the likes of Ubuntu, Debian, and SUSE, he cited Microsoft's Azure Sphere and the Windows Subsystem For Linux (WSL) 2 as examples of distro-like builds.

- Azure Sphere is Microsoft's take on edge computing, with its own flavor of Linux running on Arm-based hardware.

- It has, however, resolutely remained in preview.

- WSL 2, also in preview, is based on a tweaked version of the Linux 4.19 kernel and took a bow for Windows Insiders earlier in June.

## Iran's blame-it-on-Bitcoin 'leccy shortage probably isn't a US hack cover story... yet

-  Comment Iran claims that recent surges in electricity demand, leading to blackouts and brownouts, were caused by too many cryptocurrency miners’ power-hungry machines being hooked up to the national grid – though all may not be as it seems.

- Radio Free Europe reported that Iranian energy ministry spokesman Mostafa Rajabi blamed alt-coin miners for making the Middle Eastern nation’s electrical grid “unstable,” blaming them for a seven-per-cent jump in power demand during most of June.

- “Rajabi said the power for mining each Bitcoin equaled the power used by 24 residential units for an entire year,” reported RFE.

- The news outlet added that Iran is a hot destination for cryptocurrency mining thanks to cheap electricity and official tolerance for Bitcoin as a way of bypassing US-led sanctions on Iran.

> "Mining these currencies inside Iran will not only prevent money from leaving the country, it will also create currency under the difficult conditions of sanctions," Mohammad Shargi of Iran’s Bitcoin Society reportedly said.

- The electrical spike, however, comes just a week after Iran shot down a US RQ-4 Global Hawk spy drone, which was being flown either very close to or within Iranian airspace depending on whose version of events you believe.

- Although the Trump administration claimed to have planned a retaliatory military strike and called it off at the last minute, America does maintain what militaries call an “offensive cyber capability” – aka hacking.

- Iran is doing to our networks what it did to our spy drone, claims Uncle Sam: Now they're bombing our hard drives READ MORE Just 10 days ago Russia grudgingly admitted that news reports of US state-backed hackers planting backdoors into its electrical grid contained a “hypothetical” possibility.

## White House weighs encryption crackdown

-          Tech companies such as Apple and Google began increasing their use of end-to-end encryption in 2014.

- | Drew Angerer/Getty Images  Senior Trump administration officials met on Wednesday to discuss whether to seek legislation prohibiting tech companies from using forms of encryption that law enforcement can’t break — a provocative step that would reopen a long-running feud between federal authorities and Silicon Valley.

- The encryption challenge, which the government calls “going dark,” was the focus of a National Security Council meeting Wednesday morning that included the No.

- 2 officials from several key agencies, according to three people familiar with the matter.Story Continued Below Senior officials debated whether to ask Congress to effectively outlaw end-to-end encryption, which scrambles data so that only its sender and recipient can read it, these people told POLITICO.

- Tech companies like Apple, Google and Facebook have increasingly built end-to-end encryption into their products and software in recent years — billing it as a privacy and security feature but frustrating authorities investigating terrorism, drug trafficking and child pornography.

- “The two paths were to either put out a statement or a general position on encryption, and [say] that they would continue to work on a solution, or to ask Congress for legislation,” said one of the people.

- But the previously unreported meeting of the NSC’s so-called Deputies Committee did not produce a decision, the people said.

- A decision to press for legislation would have far-reaching consequences for the privacy and security of tens of millions of consumers and effectively force companies such as Apple and Google to water down the security features on their smartphones and other devices.

## MongoDB Leak Exposed Millions of Medical Insurance Records

-  Millions of records containing personal information and medical insurance data were exposed by a database belonging to insurance marketing website MedicareSupplement.com.

- An online database belonging to insurance marketing website MedicareSupplement.com was found exposing more than 5 million records with personal information.

- MedicareSupplement.com is a U.S.-based marketing site that allows users to find supplemental medical insurance available in their area.

- Researchers on Thursday said that they found a publicly-available MongoDB database on May 13 that had been online for several days.

- The exposed data appeared to be part of the website’s marketing leads database and did not have a password or any authentication protecting it.

- “While I have not seen any ransom notes or suspicious activity, the IP in question has been first indexed by a public search engine BinaryEdge on May 10, and closed down 5 days later,” security researcher Bob Diachenko, who discovered the database along with researchers at Comparitech, told Threatpost.

- “However, for a MongoDB being in the wild for such a long time there is a high chance it has been accessed by other actors.”  Specifically exposed were about 5 million records containing the personal data of customers.

- That data included first and last names, addresses, IP addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, and gender.

## FDA Warns of Potentially Fatal Flaws in Medtronic Insulin Pumps

-  The FDA sent out an urgent advisory warning of serious flaws in Medtronic’s insulin pumps, which are used by thousands across the U.S.

- The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency alert, warning that Medtronic MiniMed insulin pumps are vulnerable to potentially life-threatening cyberattacks.

- Specifically impacted are Medtronic’s MiniMed insulin pumps, the MiniMed 508 insulin pump and MiniMed Paradigm series insulin pumps.

- Up to 4,000 patients in the U.S. have been identified using vulnerable insulin pumps – Medtronic, which has issued a recall for the products, is still working to identify more users.

- According to the FDA’s  Thursday warning, the security flaw could enable a bad actor to connect wirelessly to a MiniMed insulin pump and change the pump’s settings, allowing them to either deliver too much insulin, or not enough – with potentially fatal results for patients.

- No fix or update for the impacted products exists.

- “Medtronic is unable to adequately update the MiniMed 508 and Paradigm insulin pumps with any software or patch to address the devices’ vulnerabilities,” according to the FDA.

- “The FDA is working to assure that Medtronic addresses this cybersecurity issue, including helping patients with affected insulin pumps switch to newer models with better cybersecurity controls.

## Iran Seizes 1,000 Bitcoin Mining Machines After Power Spike

-   Image copyright Getty Images  Image caption  Bitcoin mining centres often house hundreds or even thousands of computers dedicated to the cryptocurrency network  Authorities in Iran have seized roughly 1,000 Bitcoin mining machines from two former factories, according to state TV reports.The action was taken following a spike in electricity consumption.Demand for power rose by 7% in June and cryptocurrency mining was thought to be the main cause, an energy ministry spokesman told local state-run media.One researcher said Bitcoin was gaining more and more attention in Iran as a potential means of storing wealth.

> "Two of these bitcoin farms have been identified, with a consumption of one megawatt," Arash Navab, an electricity official, told state television.Mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin involves connecting computers - usually specialised "mining machines" - to the currency network via the internet.By providing computing power for validating transactions on that network, mining machine owners are rewarded with newly generated coins, making it a potentially lucrative exercise - especially when done on a large scale.

- Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionBitcoin explained: How do crypto-currencies work?Bitcoin mining has reportedly sprung up in a variety of locations in Iran.

> "Everyone's talking about Bitcoin and how to get it," said Mahsa Alimardani, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, who grew up in Iran.With US sanctions over its nuclear programme hitting Iran financially, Iranians often discuss via social media the question of how wealth can be stored securely, she added.

- Gold and US dollars are long-standing popular suggestions.

> "Bitcoin and [other cryptocurrencies] are slowly coming up as the third alternative," she told the BBC.

## $50 DeepNude app undresses women with a single click

-  Deepfakes: the convincing images created by sophisticated neural networks – an evolving technology that first came to light in 2017 – threaten to undercut the veracity of everything, including apparent videos of CEOs or any other public figure who can be made into an actor for the sake of fake news, undermining trust and reliability and, um… Oh, who are we kidding?

- It’s all about boobs.

- Motherboard reported this week on a $50 app called DeepNude that automatically undresses a photo of any woman with a single click, swapping the clothes for breasts and a vulva.

- And even though it sounds like it would make for a lucrative scam to simply cook up the name DeepNude, sit back and watch those $50 charges rack up, this was for real.

- After Motherboard’s exposure, the site was swept offline by a tidal wave of drool: Hi!

- DeepNude is offline.

- Why?

- Because we did not expect these visits and our servers need reinforcement.

## Bulgarian IT expert arrested after demoing vulnerability in kindergarten software | ZDNet

- Bulgarian IT expert arrested after demoing vulnerability in kindergarten software Vulnerability allowed him to download data of over 235,000 Bulgarian citizens.

- Bulgarian authorities have arrested an IT specialist for demonstrating a security flaw in the software used by local kindergartens.The vulnerability allowed the IT expert, named Petko Petrov, to download the details of 235,543 citizens of Stara Zagora, a province in central Bulgaria with over 333,000 inhabitants.Petkov demoed the security flaw in a video he posted on Facebook earlier this week, on June 25.The video shows Petkov launch an automated attack against the local municipality's web portal where parents can sign up children for kindergarten, and using the security flaw to obtain data of Bulgarian citizens.In a caption posted with the Facebook video, Petkov said he tried to contact the software maker and local authorities but was ignored.He posted the code on GitHubThe Facebook caption also included a link to a GitHub repository where anyone could download the code for exploiting the vulnerability.

- Following Petkov's public disclosure, Bulgarian authorities arrested the security researcher on Friday.

- He was jailed for 24 hours but was subsequentially set free.Local prosecutors are still pending charges under Article 319A of the Bulgarian Criminal Code, on accusations of obtaining government information using illegal methods.

- If charged and found guilty, Petkov faces from one to three years in prison, and a fine of up to 5,000 Bulgarian leva ($2,900), according to local press [1, 2, 3, 4].Same software used in other provinces In the meantime, Stara Zagora officials have taken down the vulnerable software.

- The mayor of the city of Stara Zagora told local media[1, 2, 3] that the software maker has not responded to requests for comments from government officials.The Stara Zagora mayor said the company, named Information Services AD, will have to fix its software on its own expense.Petkov said the same software is also used in other Bulgarian provinces, meaning hackers may have an open door to harvest Bulgarian citizens' data.

- The data collected via the vulnerability Petkov found includes information usually stored inside a central national database managed by the Department Civil Registration and Administrative Services (GRAO).According to its website, the GRAO's database "is like the Social Security Number (or similar) identification in other countries.

> ""The system stores as personal data names, addresses, marital status, death, parentage, passport data, nationality and relatives - children, brothers and sisters of about 10.5 million citizens (counting 2 million dead people)."

## Plain wrong: Millions of utility customers’ passwords stored in plain text

-   217  with 100 posters participating, including story author  In September of 2018, an anonymous independent security researcher (who we'll call X) noticed that their power company's website was offering to email—not reset!—lost account passwords to forgetful users.

- Startled, X fed the online form the utility account number and the last four phone number digits it was asking for.

- Sure enough, a few minutes later the account password, in plain text, was sitting in X's inbox.

- This was frustrating and insecure, and it shouldn't have happened at all in 2018.

- But this turned out to be a flaw common to websites designed by the Atlanta firm SEDC.

- After finding SEDC's copyright notices in the footer of the local utility company's website, X began looking for more customer-facing sites designed by SEDC.

- X found and confirmed SEDC's footer—and the same offer to email plain-text passwords—in more than 80 utility company websites.

- Those companies service 15 million or so clients (estimated from GIS data and in some cases from PR brags on the utility sites themselves).

## Mozilla omits CPU architecture information from Firefox's user agent - gHacks Tech News

- Mozilla plans to omit CPU architecture information from Firefox's user agent and several supported APIs to reduce the digital fingerprint of Firefox users.Web browsers reveal information automatically to websites that users open in the applications.

- The user agent reveals information about the browser and browser version, operating system, and, up until recently, also the CPU architecture.Fingerprinting scripts use user agent information and other information, e.g.

- language and location, to create digital fingerprints.

- The accuracy of fingerprints increases with the number of unique data points.Firefox won't reveal one of the information bits to scripts and sites anymore going forward.

- The change, implemented already in recent Firefox Nightly 69 builds, omits CPU architecture information from the user agent.Firefox used to differentiate between the following CPU architectures:32-bit Firefox on 32-bit operating systems.32-bit Firefox on 64-bit operating systems.64-bit Firefox on 64-bit operating systems.Firefox users who run Firefox 69 will notice that scripts that return the user agent won't differentiate the information anymore.

- A simply Google search for check user agent reveals that as seen on the screenshot below.The current Nightly version of Firefox run on a test system returns the following user agent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:69.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/69.0The change affects 32-bit Firefox installations that run on 64-bit versions of a Windows or Linux operating system.

- These versions will use the following user agent as of Firefox 69:Linux: Linux x86_64 instead Linux i686 on x86_64Windows: Win64 instead of WOW64The change applies to the user agent and the APIs navigator.userAgent, navigator.platform, and navigator.oscpu.Modifying the user agent information in this way is a low risk change according to Mozilla that should not impact functionality or compatibility.Mozilla's plugin finder service used the information provided by the user agent to direct users to the correct Flash Player download.

- Adobe Flash is the last plugin that Firefox supports but the installer is universal so that a differentiation is no longer necessary.

## Cop a load of this: 1TB of police body camera videos found lounging around public databases

-  In yet another example of absent security controls, troves of police body camera footage were left open to the world for anyone to siphon off, according to an infosec biz.

- Jasun Tate, CEO of Black Alchemy Solutions Group, told The Register on Monday he and his team had identified about a terabyte of officer body cam videos, stored in unprotected internet-facing databases, belonging to the Miami Police Department, and cops in other US cities as well as places aboard.

- The operators of these databases – Tate suggests there are five service providers involved – work with various police departments.

- The footage apparently dates from 2018 to present.

> "Vendors that provide services to police departments are insecure," said Tate, adding that he could not at present identify the specific vendors responsible for leaving the archive freely accessible to the public.

- Below is an example body-cam video from the internet-facing data silo Tate shared on Twitter.

- What is more distrubing about 1 terrabyte of police body cam videos from 2018-present that we just found on the darknet is that @MiamiPD and the other cities DAs are going to have a long day when they finally realize the 5 IT service providers they use are no #Infosec aware.

## White House mulls just banning strong end-to-end crypto. Plus: More bad stuff in infosec land

-  Roundup As June turns over to July, here are some additional bits of security news besides our regular infosec coverage.

- Trump officials mull: Why not just ban strong encryption?

- Haven't we done this before?

- The White House is said to be weighing a plan to force US tech giants, software and hardware makers, and other companies, to deploy only encryption, particular only end-to-end cryptography, that can be cracked by American law enforcement, or ban it outright.

- A report by Politico claims Trump administration officials met this month and kicked around the idea of asking Congress to pass legislation that would effectively ban the use of strong end-to-end encryption.

- This threat reemerges despite repeated warnings from cryptographers and security professionals that any plan to weaken encryption would be a disaster – it weakens people's electronic security against criminals, hackers, and foreign agents, for one thing – and trying to ban it outright would have major consequences for data security.

- Excel PowerQuery could pose a security risk  Bug-hunters have found yet another way Microsoft Office documents could be used to sneak malware onto the PCs of careless users.

- This time, it is researchers with Mimecast who have uncovered a vulnerability in the way Excel spreadsheets use a feature called PowerQuery.

## Billions of Records Including Passwords Leaked by Smart Home Vendor

-   A publicly accessible ElasticSearch cluster owned by Orvibo, a Chinese smart home solutions provider, leaked more than two billion user logs containing sensitive data of customers from countries all over the world.

- Orvibo provides its clients with smart solutions designed to help them manage houses, offices, and hotel rooms via smart systems that offer security and energy management, as well as remote control and data recording/analysis using a smart home cloud platform.

- Among the devices Orvibo's smart home solutions allow its users to control, the company's cloud platform comes with support for interaction center, smart lighting, home security, HVAC, energy management, and home entertainment devices.

- Sample of Orvibo leaked data The exposed Orvibo database "includes over 2 billion logs that record everything from usernames, email addresses, and passwords, to precise locations" and it's still online given that the company did not respond to vpnMentor‘s research team who reached out on June 16.

- As the researchers also state, "as long as the database remains open, the amount of data available continues to increase each day," with users from all over the world including China, Japan, Thailand, the US, the UK, Mexico, France, Australia, and Brazil being affected by the data leak.

- Among the customer data exposed by the unprotected Elasticsearch cluster were:  • Email addresses • Passwords • Account reset codes • Precise user geolocation • IP addresses • Username & UserID • Family name & Family ID • Device name & Device that accessed account • Recorded conversations through Smart Camera • Scheduling information  The database leaked account reset codes that might allow potential attackers to lock Orvibo users out of their accounts without the need of using the users' passwords in the process.

- To make things even worse, by changing both the password and the email address, the account could be unrecoverable providing hackers with "full control of their smart home devices."

- The vpnMentor research team found that "the video feed from the smart cameras is easily accessible by entering the owner’s account with the credentials found in the database" for users who added security cameras to their Orvibo smart home management accounts.

## Threat Actor Poisons OpenPGP Certificates

-  Poisoned certificates are in the OpenPGP SKS keyserver network after an unknown threat actor targeted the OpenPGP certificates of two high-profile community contributors.

- The attack happened in the last week of June and exploited a defect in the OpenPGP protocol itself to poison the OpenPGP certificates of Robert J. Hansen and Daniel Kahn Gillmor, known in the community as "rjh" and "dkg."

- The immediate effect of the attack was that the poisoned certificates ended up in the SKS keyserver network and that anyone attempting to import a poisoned certificate into a vulnerable OpenPGP installation would likely break their installation.

- “There is no reason to believe the attacker will stop at just poisoning two certificates.

- Further, given the ease of the attack and the highly publicized success of the attack, it is prudent to believe other certificates will soon be poisoned,” Hansen notes.

- The attack, he explains, will not be mitigated by the SKS keyserver network or the OpenPGP Working Group in a reasonable time period, though some mitigations will likely be included in a future release of OpenPGP.

- “The best mitigation that can be applied at present is simple: stop retrieving data from the SKS keyserver network,” Hansen says.

- The keyserver software and network were built three decades ago to facilitate the discovery and distribution of public certificates, and keyservers have a major flaw: they don’t delete information about a certificate.

-  A hacking group has gained access to the internal infrastructure of large cloud services provider PCM.

- California-based PCM provides a mixture of solutions including cloud services and hardware, and made over $2bn in revenues in 2018.

- According to a report by specialist cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs, the company discovered the breach in mid-May.

- Sources told him that the attackers stole administrative credentials for Office 365 accounts, and that they were mostly interested in using stolen data to conduct gift card fraud.

- The modus operandi in this case was similar to other attacks on large IT providers we’ve seen, in which the hacking group sends phishing emails to companies including retailers, employee reward programs, customer loyalty and recognition businesses, and other organizations dealing in gift cards.

- After compromising a system, the group would use a custom version of a malware strain called Mimikatz, which collects usernames and passwords from memory.

- Once the group has access to the infrastructure of companies that deal in gift cards, it would then use money transfer services, payment processing services, and clearing houses to monetize that information.

- The report added: A possible theory for targeting could be that gift cards provide access to liquid assets outside of the traditional western financial system.

## Android co-founder Andy Rubin accused of cheating wife out of fortune while running a sex ring

-  Android co-founder Andy Rubin has been accused of cheating his wife out of millions through a prenuptial agreement obtained under false pretenses, according to documents unsealed in connection with a related case.

- The documents — first unearthed by BuzzFeed’s Ryan Mac — allege that Rubin forced his wife Rie Hiraburu Rubin into the prenuptial agreement just weeks before she was scheduled to give birth to their child, negotiating specific terms until three days before the couple’s city hall wedding.

- The lawsuit seeks to annul that agreement, which resulted in Rie being cut out of much of the wealth Andy obtained from Google and his later Essential project.

- As a complaint, the document is only an allegation and has not been confirmed by the court.

- Still, it echoes a number of details reported by the New York Times in October, including the allegation that Andy supported a string of mistresses, who would often be loaned to other men in what he described as “an ownership relationship.” The complaint alleges Andy had at least five such mistresses, including one (dubbed “M”) who was “complicit with Rubin in running what appeared to be a sex ring.” The complaint also alleges that Andy diverted joint funds in order to make personal payouts to a number of women, payouts consistent with the Times’ reporting.

- According to the complaint, he stopped depositing his Google paychecks in the couple’s joint account in February 2014, shortly after he left the company amid allegations of sexual misconduct.

- But Andy continued to be paid by the company, subject to his severance agreement, and simply had the deposits diverted to an individual account, which made hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to other women.

- Her lawyer had allegedly represented Andy in a previous divorce The central claim of the complaint is a breach of duty by Rie’s lawyer, which could invalidate the agreement if affirmed by the court.

## We are shocked to learn oppressive authoritarian surveillance state China injects spyware into foreigners' smartphones

-  Authorities in a tumultuous region of China are ordering tourists and other visitors to install spyware on their smartphones, it is claimed.

- The New York Times reported today that guards working the border with Krygyzstan, in China's Xinjiang region, have insisted visitors put an app called Fengcai on their Android devices – and that includes tourists, journalists, and other foreigners.

- The Android app is said to harvest details from the handset ranging from text messages and call records to contacts and calendar entries.

- It also apparently checks to see if the device contains any of 73,000 proscribed documents, including missives from terrorist groups, including ISIS recruitment fliers and bomb-making instructions.

- China being China, it also looks for information on the Dalai Lama and – bizarrely – mentions of a Japanese grindcore band.

- Visitors using iPhones had their mobes connected to a different, hardware-based device that is believed to install similar spyware.

- No Telegram today, protestors: Chinese boxes DDoS chat app amid Hong Kong protest READ MORE This is not the first report of Chinese authorities using spyware to keep tabs on people in the Xinjiang region, though it is the first time tourists are believed to have been the primary target.

- The app doesn't appear to be used at any other border crossings into the Middle Kingdom.

## Encrypted DNS and SNI Make Pirate Site Blocking Much Harder

- Website blocking has become a prime measure for the entertainment industry to target pirate sites on the Internet.

- The practice has been around for well over a decade and has gradually expanded to dozens of countries around the world.

- The actual blocking is done by Internet providers, often following a court order.

- These measures can range from simple DNS blocks to more elaborate schemes involving Server Name Indication (SNI) eavesdropping, or a combination of both.

- Thus far, the more thorough blocking efforts have worked relatively well.

- However, there’s a growing concern among network specialists that blocking and filtering could become problematic in the future as technology moves forward.

- For example, tech companies are increasingly starting to adopt DNS over HTTPS (DoH or encrypted DNS).

- This makes it possible to resolve domain names over the secure HTTPS protocol.

## G20 Supports Proposal To Make Cryptocurrency Exchanges Hand Over User Data

-    Facebook offers peek into its future Libra cryptocurrency The social network’s rumored cryptocurrency has landed, but how it will be received remains to be seen.

- The Group of Twenty (G20) has announced its support for new cryptocurrency guidelines which would make exchanges hand over user data to regulators.

- As reported by The Block, the international forum -- including Europe, the US, China, Japan, and South Korea -- revealed their approval at the 2019 G20 summit, held in Osaka at the end of June.

- A set of proposed guidelines designed to combat the issue of money laundering made possible through the exchange and 'washing' of cryptocurrency funds, often anonymized through blockchain technologies and wallets, was published by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) last month.

- CNET: Trump to let US firms sell tech to Huawei The guidelines recommend that regulatory bodies overseeing cryptocurrency exchanges and services -- labeled as virtual asset service providers by FATF -- should adopt a "risk-based approach" (.PDF) to tackle cryptocurrency-based mixing and laundering.

- FATF recommends that cryptocurrency organizations should be obliged to obtain, hold, and when necessary, transmit information concerning account holders -- especially when transactions take place which are deemed suspicious.

- See also: Fish ponds disguised theft of oil field power in cryptocurrency mining scheme    This information which may be gathered includes the names of those involved in a transaction, wallet addresses, physical addresses, beneficiary account numbers, national identity numbers and dates of birth.

- The G20 said it was "reaffirming our commitment" to implement the FATF standards to virtual assets.Now that the G20 has now provided its official support the guidelines may potentially become common law in many countries in the future.

## Slurp – Amazon AWS S3 Bucket Enumerator

- Slurp is a blackbox/whitebox S3 bucket enumerator written in Go that can use a permutations list to scan from an external perspective or an AWS API to scan internally.

- There are two modes that this tool operates at; blackbox and whitebox mode.

- Whitebox mode (or internal) is significantly faster than blackbox (external) mode.

- Blackbox (external) In this mode, you are using the permutations list to conduct scans.

- It will return false positives and there is NO WAY to link the buckets to an actual AWS account.

- Whitebox (internal) In this mode, you are using the AWS API with credentials on a specific account that you own to see what is open.

- This method pulls all S3 buckets and checks Policy/ACL permissions.

- Your credentials should be in ~/.aws/credentials.

## Cloudflare Worldwide Outage Caused by Bad Software Deployment

-   Cloudfare experienced a worldwide outage today for about 30 minutes, with network performance issues that brought down a multitude of websites and web services all around the world, and triggered "502 Bad Gateway" errors.

- While various speculations said that the provider of content delivery network and DDoS mitigation services was being under attack, Cloudfare's John Graham-Cumming says that the 502 errors seen by visitors of Cloudfare sites were actually caused by a spike in CPU utilization on the provider's network.

> "This CPU spike was caused by a bad software deploy that was rolled back," adds Graham-Cumming.

> "Once rolled back the service returned to normal operation and all domains using Cloudflare returned to normal traffic levels."

> "This was not an attack (as some have speculated) and we are incredibly sorry that this incident occurred," also stated Graham-Cumming in a post on the company's official blog.

- Cloudfare was not under attack The Cloudfare blog post confirms what the company's CEO said on Twitter during the network outage:  No evidence this was an attack.

- Please don’t jump to conclusions.

- — Matthew Prince (@eastdakota) July 2, 2019 Prince also tweeted about the network issues experienced by Cloudfare during the incident, reassuring customers that the team was "working on getting to the bottom of what’s going on."

## First-ever malware strain spotted abusing new DoH (DNS over HTTPS) protocol | ZDNet

-    Ten malware families linked to Necurs botnet found on US servers It is unusual for such malware to be found on infrastructure hosted in the US.

- Security researchers from Netlab, a network threat hunting unit of Chinese cyber-security giant Qihoo 360, have discovered the first ever malware strain seen abusing the DNS over HTTPS (DoH) protocol.The malware, named Godlua, was detailed in a report published on Monday by the company's researchers.According to the Netlab team, Godlua is a malware strain written in Lua, which acts like a backdoor on infected systems.

- It's written to work on Linux servers, attackers are using a Confluence exploit (CVE-2019-3396) to infect outdated systems, and early samples uploaded on VirusTotal have mislabeled it as a cryptocurrency miner.But Netlab researchers say the malware actually works as a DDoS bot and they've already seen it being used in attacks, with one aimed against liuxiaobei.com, the homepage of a Liu Xiaobei fan site.DoH helps malware avoid passive DNS monitoringResearchers say they've spotted two Godlua versions so far, with a somewhat similar architecture.

- Both versions used DNS over HTTPS requests to retrieve the TXT (text record) of a domain name, where the URL of a subsequent command and control (C&C) server was being stored, and to which the Godlua malware was supposed to connect for further instructions.

- This technique of retrieving the URL addresses of second/third stage C&C server from DNS text records isn't new.

- The newness here is the usage of a DoH request instead of a classical DNS request.As the protocol's name clearly states, DNS over HTTPS works by sending DNS requests via an encrypted HTTPS connection, rather than using a classic plaintext UDP request.

- The DoH (DNS) request is encrypted and invisible to third-party observers, including cyber-security software that relies on passive DNS monitoring to block requests to known malicious domains.Looming problem for cyber-security communityThe discovery that Godlua uses DoH to hide DNS traffic sent shockwaves through the cyber-security community this week, with many reacting on both Twitter [1, 2] and Reddit.

- DNS requests aren't the only IOC, but they're leaned-on heavily.— Wesley McGrew (@McGrewSecurity) July 3, 2019  Many have expressed fears that other malware strains will now also adopt this feature, rendering a large chunk of cyber-security products that rely on passive DNS monitoring useless.Their fear is justified; however, the cyber-security community has always found workarounds to any tricks malware employs, and it's expected they'll find one to deal with any strains that use DoH, as well.More info on the DoH protocol can be found in the Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF) document RFC 8484.Major browsers like Firefox and Chrome already support DoH.

## YouTube policy on removing ‘instructional hacking’ content causes infosec community outrage | ZDNet

-    Hacking campaign compromised 10 global telcos to steal data from high-value targets Researchers at Cybereason say a nation-state-backed intelligence operation has compromised at least 10 global telco companies - to such an extent the attackers run a "de facto shadow IT department".

- YouTube recently decided that instructional content in the realm of cybersecurity, including hacking how-to videos, were not acceptable on the ad-driven video platform.

- There is a gray area to be sure when it comes to teaching people not only how to hack but also educating users more broadly about the infosec industry -- and this fine line between educational purposes and guides for more nefarious activities needs to be publicly maintained.

- However, you can tell the difference, for example, between a guide on what various types of vulnerabilities are and a video on how to create ransomware, and what appeared to be a recent policy change at YouTube has managed to cause an uproar.

- As reported by 9to5Google, Google's YouTube updated its content policy this week to spell out what is considered "harmful or dangerous content."

- The list includes "Instructional hacking and phishing: Showing users how to bypass secure computer systems or steal user credentials and personal data."

- Originally, it seemed that the policy change was new, but as reports surfaced of the changes, YouTube added a comment to the policy page insisting "[this] now includes more examples of content that violates this policy.

- There are no policy changes.

## Seriously? Cisco put Huawei X.509 certificates and keys into its own switches | ZDNet

-    Cisco: DNS attacks will undermine trust in the internet Sophisticated hacking group taps wide set of vulnerabilities as part of their global hacking spree.

- Cisco has disclosed a bunch of vulnerabilities in its networking equipment, including one embarrassing bug that put the West's tech boogeyman inside the US firm's kit.

- Cisco is telling customers to apply updates for 18 high- and medium-severity vulnerabilities in its products, plus one curious bug it labels 'informational' that affects its Small Business 250, 350, 350X, and 550X Series Switches.

- The bugs in these switches are not serious enough to get its own CVE identifier, but they do provide a lesson in the well-known risks of using third-party open-source components in products without running proper security checks on them.

- SEE: A winning strategy for cybersecurity (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)Researchers at SEC Technologies, the IoT division of security firm SEC Consult, were using its IoT Inspector bug-hunting software to probe firmware images of Cisco's Small Business 250 Series Switches and found they contained digital certificates and keys issued to Futurewei Technologies.

- Futurewei Technologies is the US-based R&D arm of Huawei.

- Apparently in response to the US ban on Huawei using US tech, the research division is reportedly planning to separate from the Chinese mothership, and has also banned Huawei workers from its offices, dropped the Huawei logo, and created its own separated IT system for staff.

- But the question is why would a US tech giant like Cisco, which has sued Huawei over patents, put its Chinese rival's certificates and keys into its own switches?
