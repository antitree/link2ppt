## New KRACK Attack Against Wi-Fi Encryption

-  New KRACK Attack Against Wi-Fi Encryption Mathy Vanhoef has just published a devastating attack against WPA2, the 14-year-old encryption protocol used by pretty much all wi-fi systems

- Its an interesting attack, where the attacker forces the protocol to reuse a key

- The authors call this attack KRACK, for Key Reinstallation Attacks This is yet another of a series of marketed attacks; with a cool name, a website, and a logo

- The QA on the website answers a lot of questions about the attack and its implications

- And lots of good information in this ArsTechnica article. There is an academic paper, too: "Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2," by Mathy Vanhoef and Frank Piessens

- Abstract: We introduce the key reinstallation attack

- This attack abuses design or implementation flaws in cryptographic protocols to reinstall an already-in-use key

- This resets the key's associated parameters such as transmit nonces and receive replay counters

## Unpatched vulnerability discovered in Subaru key fobs allowing for easy exploits and cloning

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/ehyos7zVOHLTa/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc998c3158373655b34c2b)

-  A Dutch electronics designer named Tom Wimmenhove has discovered a vulnerability in the key fob system used by several Subaru vehicles

- By exploiting the vulnerability, a thief can clone a key fob and gain access to a vehicle with relative ease

- Wimmenhove says he informed Subaru of the security flaw but was not taken seriously and the issue has not been patched. The key fob sends out a code which the car interprets to unlock the doors

- Typically these codes are randomized to prevent hackers from reusing a previous code, but Subaru's implementation is flawed

- By capturing a single packet from a working key fob, the attacker can use Wimmenhove's code to predict the next rolling code and unlock the car

- He has nicknamed this the fobrob exploit.  Creating the device is simple and inexpensive

- As a proof of concept, Wimmenhove executed the script on his phone and used a Wi-Fi dongle, a TV dongle, and a 433MHz antenna

- The software can run on a Raspberry Pi and the antennas cost just a few dollars

## Flash 0-day in the wild  patch now!

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/5GdhgaBpA3oCA/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc998d586551474dff2afa)

-    by     This past Patch Tuesday, Adobe released, well, nothing

- Given that the past few months of Adobe Patch Tuesdays have been gradually diminishing, perhaps some of us thought these Flash-related patches were going the way of the dodo. Alas, it was wishful thinking. Six days after Patch-Tuesday-that-wasnt, Adobe has released an out-of-band patch for Flash in response to a zero-day vulnerability thats being exploited in the wild. This Flash vulnerability, CVE-2017-11292, could allow remote code execution, and is rated as Critical

- It affects Flash both in browsers and on desktop players, on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS.   Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More   Adobe notes that this vulnerability is being exploited in the wild, specifically by a criminal group that has previously used other Flash vulnerabilities to carry out their attacks. Sophos disrupts the attack by blocking the URL that malware is downloaded from, and by detecting the malware itself as Mal/Generic-S. Nevertheless, if youre still using Adobe Flash, you should patch right away. But better yet, get rid of Flash altogether (if you can). Even Adobe knows that its beleaguered media players days are numbered

- Browser vendors have been trying to sweep it further and further under the rug for years and in July Adobe announced that it was finally pulling the plug. By the end of 2020. Given this progress, and in collaboration with several of our technology partners  including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla  Adobe is planning to end-of-life Flash

- Specifically, we will stop updating and distributing the Flash Player at the end of 2020 and encourage content creators to migrate any existing Flash content to these new open formats. Theres another forty or so Patch Tuesdays between now and then. Flashs days are very numbered but its having an agonising, protracted exit

- For everyones sake its demise really cant come soon enough

- Adobes waiting until 2021, you dont have to. Follow @mvarmazis Follow @NakedSecurity

## Linux kernel community tries to castrate GPL copyright troll

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/Ot8nXtNRn9gek/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc998e68546d6d770d4111)

-  Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman and several other senior Linux figures have published a Linux Kernel Community Enforcement Statement to be included in future Linux documentation, in order to ensure contributions to the kernel don't fall foul of copyright claims that have already seen a single developer win "at least a few million Euros. In a post released on Monday, October 16th, Kroah-Hartman explained the Statement's needed because not everyone who contributes to the kernel understands the obligations the GNU Public Licence 2.0 (GPL 2.0), and the licence has ambiguities ... that no one in our community has ever considered part of compliance. Those ambiguities, he writes, have been used by a developer named Patrick McHardy to run multiple copyright enforcement lawsuits.  Copyright in open source? WTF? Most open source licences allow re-use of code, provided modifications are released under the same licence as the original. But it is possible for segments of code to be subject to copyright, too

- Developers need only leave a copyright claim in code or documentation to do so. Proving copyright in existing open source projects is hard

- The Hellwig vs

- VMware case foundered on the fact that the plaintiff couldn't show exactly which lines the Linux kernel had made it into VMware products.  McHardy is a former contributor to a project called Netfilter that brings useful networking functionality such as network address translation to Linux

- However the project suspended him from its core team in 2016 over license enforcement activities that contravened the project's own policies

- He's also been criticised by the Software Freedom Conservancy for prioritizing financial gain over compliance. Lawyer Heather Meeker believes that McHardy wrote well under .25% of the code in the kernel but has parlayed that into around 50 copyright complaints about Linux companies' use of Netfilter

- Most of his actions take place in Germany, where local law makes such claims easier to mount. Kroah-Hartman says It is not possible to know an exact figure due to the secrecy of Patricks actions, but we are aware of activity that has resulted in payments of at least a few million Euros

- We are also aware that these actions, which have continued for at least four years, have threatened the confidence in our ecosystem. To restore that confidence, the Statement adopts the same termination provisions we are all familiar with from GPL-3.0 as an Additional Permission giving companies confidence that they will have time to come into compliance if a failure is identified. Those provisions are:  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.  Their ability to rely on this Additional Permission will hopefully re-establish user confidence and help direct enforcement activity back to the original purpose we have all sought over the years  actual compliance, say Kroah-Hartman and his co-authors wrote. The Register has approached McHardy for comment, but as he's reportedly a reluctant correspondent when asked about his legal activities we don't hold out much hope of a reply

## The Flawed System Behind the Krack Wi-Fi Meltdown

![lurl](https://media1.giphy.com/media/QnylzNImvxf8I/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc998f312f44436759c376)

- On Monday, the security community scrambled to unpack Krack, a fundamental vulnerability in the ubiquitous, secure Wi-Fi network standard known a WPA2

- Though some of the most popular devices are mercifully already protected (like most of those that run Windows and iOS), a staggering population remains exposed to data theft and manipulation every time they connect to WPA2 Wi-Fi

- But as another interminable patching process begins, a different conversation is picking up, too, about how to catch flaws in crucial standards more quickly, and make it easier to patch them.No software is perfect

- Bugs are inevitable now and then

- But experts say that software standards that impact millions of devices are too often developed behind closed doors, making it difficult for the broader security community to assess potential flaws and vulnerabilities early on

- They can lack full documentation even months or years after their release."If there is one thing to learn from this, it's that standards can't be closed off from security researchers," says Robert Graham, an analyst for the cybersecurity firm Erratasec

> "The bug here is actually pretty easy to prevent, and pretty obvious

- It's the fact that security researchers couldn't get their hands on the standards that meant that it was able to hide."The WPA2 protocol was developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), which acts as a standards body for numerous technical industries, including wireless security

## BoundHook: Microsoft downplays Windows systems exploit technique

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/SEQCoVccVrGQ8/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99915851424a511128c0)

-  Features of the Intel MPX designed to prevent memory errors and attacks might be abused to launch assaults on Windows systems, security researchers claim. Windows 10 uses Intel to secure applications by detecting boundary exceptions (common during a buffer overflow attack)

- An exploit technique by CyberArk Labs uses the boundary exception as the hook itself to give attackers control of Windows 10 devices. The researchers claim the so-called "BoundHook" technique creates a potential mechanism for hackers to exploit design of Intel Memory Protection Extensions to hook applications in user mode and execute code

- According to CyberArk Labs, this malfeasance could, in theory, allow attacks to fly under the radar of antiviruses or other security measures on Windows 10, 32-bit and 64-bit OS devices. Microsoft has downplayed the significance of the potential attack, telling CyberArk Labs that it's only useful as a technique for post-hack exploitation

- MS dismisses the research as a "marketing report" from which The Reg infers it sees no need to have the tech patched. A Microsoft spokesperson told The Reg: "The technique described in this marketing report does not represent a security vulnerability and requires a machine to already be compromised to potentially work

- We encourage customers to always keep their systems updated for the best protection." BoundHook is the second known technique discovered by CyberArk Labs to hook functions in Windows

- The first technique, dubbed GhostHook, bypasses Microsoft attempts to prevent kernel-level attacks (e.g

- PatchGuard) and uses this hooking approach to take control of a device

- Microsoft dismissed the potential route of that attack as a low-risk threat, as we previously reported

## Hack a BT Low Energy (BLE) butt plug

-  Butt plug  Hush by Lovesense Few weeks ago I bought a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) butt plug to test the (in)security of BLE protocol. This caught my attention after researchers told us that a lot of sex toys use this protocol to allow remote control that is insecure by design. The great Simone evilsocket Margaritelli wrote a BLE scanner called BLEAH (get it on github) and a wonderful post on how to use it to hack BLE devices

- I strongly suggest you to read the post before moving on. Everything started as a joke between me and Simone before going to HackInBo (the best free security event in Italy) when Simone said to me if you buy it we pentest it in Bologna. I bought it  and during HackInBo we hacked the butt plug using BLEAH (Lovense Hush model)

- Simone deserves all the creditis for this, I just learned from him. The offer from @evilsocket This is the final result

- I paired to the BLE butt plug device without authentication or PIN from my laptop and sent the vibrate command.  How get the command? The butt plug can be remotely controlled with a mobile application called Lovense Remote (download here). With jadx you can disassemble the java application and find the Bluetooth class used to control the device

- Inside you can find the strings to be sent to the toy to start vibration (Vibrate:20;). Lovense Remote disassembled So we have all the elements to hack the sex toy with BLEAH (read evilsocket post before) as follow: // scan for the device $ sudo bleah -t0 // get device services and characteristics $ sudo bleah -b " DEVICE MAC " -e // send the vibrate command to the writable charateristic $ sudo bleah -b " DEVICE MAC " -u  CHARATERISTIC UUID  -d "Vibrate:20;" Hack all the things At the end is very easy to hack BLE protocol due to poor design choices

- Welcome to 2017. Welcome to 2017   Advertisements

## Russia tweaks Telegram with tiny fine for decryption denial

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/wYyAgjRSnAFt6/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99935762647663741f5b)

-  Encrypted messaging app Telegram must pay 800,000 roubles for resisting Russia's FSB's demand that it help decrypt user messages. The fine translates to just under US$14,000, making it less of a serious punishment and more a shot across the bows. However, it does seem to entrench the principle that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) can demand decryption. Moscow signalled its intention to crack down last year with legislation put to the Duma, proposing fines up to a million roubles for the administrative offence of not giving keys to the FSB. Telegram's head office received its summons in July, according to this Russian-language report from the BBC

- The summons demanded information about six numbers registered on the Telegram. Judge Yulia Danilchik of the 383 Meshchansky District Court of Justice made the guilty finding and imposed the fine. Telegram founder Pavel Durov has posted to Russian social site VK.com that it's not possible to comply. In addition to the fact that the requirements of the FSB are not technically feasible, they contradict Article 23 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation: 'Everyone has the right to privacy of correspondence, telephone conversations, postal, telegraphic and other communications,' he wrote. He indicated his intention to appeal, and keep doing so until the claim of the FSB is considered by a judge familiar with the basic law of Russia - its Constitution

## Domino's Pizza delivers user details to spammers

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/3o6Zt8PYT58ydBNgpa/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc9995794c356d77f5c9c4)

-  Domino's Pizza's Australian outpost has blamed a partner for a security breach, after angry customers went online complaining about finding themselves on spam lists. The company owned up to the breach after Redditor Pinchie McPinch complained about receiving e-mails from Sarah and Jess. What tipped Pinchie that the data may have come from the pizza chain was that the spammers were referring to his/her favourite Domino's locations to make the approaches look more plausible. Domino's acknowledged the breach and said it is investigating what happened

- The company blamed the breach on an unnamed former supplier. The company's statement says the breach was limited to email addresses, names and store suburbs (related to pizza orders) ... at no time has customer financial information (including credit cards) or passwords, been accessed or compromised. The statement added that the company will work closely with the relevant privacy authorities in Australia. Electronic Frontiers Australia board member Peter Tonoli isn't satisfied with Domino's handling of the situation:  How about @Dominos_AU contact their customers about the privacy breach, instead of relying of customers unawareness of the problem? Asking customers to email Dominos is disingenuous and opaque #privacy #databreach @OAICgov pic.twitter.com/Bw6f5bezxZ  Peter Tonoli (@peter_tonoli) October 17, 2017 It seems the unnamed supplier was a trans-Tasman operation, since last week similar complaints emerged in New Zealand. The Register has asked Domino's for comment

- And a Supreme for lunch, plus a Coke Zero.*   *Not really.  Update: A Domino's spokesperson has sent a statement to The Register which mostly reproduces what is on its Website, but which confirms it has notified the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner of he breach.

## Printers: The Weak Link in Enterprise Security

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/l2JhwdnrGvfnoXrzi/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99964762464845a7dfeb)

- Organizations frequently overlook printer security, leaving systems exposed to malware and theft

- New tools aim to lessen the risk.PC security has become a priority for security leaders following global ransomware attacks earlier this year

- If they didn't before, everyone from CISOs to everyday consumers knows it's a bad idea to ignore security updates or use simple, breakable passwords. This heightened awareness does not extend to printers, however, and hackers are exploiting poor printer security practices. "Unlike PCs, where there's a full appreciation for the need to secure those devices, there's much less awareness to the need to secure print devices," says Ed Wingate, VP and GM for HP's JetAdvantage Solutions, noting that strong security practices for protecting PCs and other nodes on the network are not consistently deployed to printers. Weak link in the IoT Sam McLane, who runs the security engineering team at Arctic Wolf, says he is far less concerned about today's printers than about yesterday's printers

- Many organizations, especially smaller ones, use printers around five to eight years old, and haven't updated them. "Printers, specifically, have a much longer shelf life than any of the other IoT devices, and they were the earliest of the adopted devices," he explains

> "People will run them into the ground and then some before they start replacing them." This poses an especially big problem to small offices using consumer-grade devices, McLane continues

- SMBs don't have the need or budget for high-end enterprise level printers, and make the mistake of sending corporate data into the cloud with lower levels of protection on a device meant to be in someone's house and not necessarily in a corporate environment. "Someone could get into a computer via malware; printers advertise themselves well," says McLane

> "If a laptop or desktop gets compromised, a printer is a great spot to put malicious code that everyone talks to ... it's a built-in platform to launch attacks." Common printer slip-ups Most frequent mistakes include employing weak or default passwords, and neglecting to update firmware

> "Printers are not always updated with the latest firmware," HP's Wingate adds

## Here's a timeless headline: Adobe rushes out emergency Flash fix after hacker exploits bug

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/hfkIIZM4AsBW0/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99977a43385a739819cb)

-  Adobe today issued an emergency security patch for Flash, which squashes a bug being used in the wild right now by hackers to infect Windows PCs with spyware. The flaw, CVE-2017-11292, was discovered by Kaspersky Labs, and affects all current versions of Flash for Windows, macOS, Linux and Chrome OS

- A programming cockup in the software allows malicious Flash files  hidden on websites or embedded in Office documents and other files  to corrupt the plugin's internal memory structures and gain remote code execution on a vulnerable machine. As mentioned, this is a zero-day hole: it is being actively exploited against computers to infect them with malware

- Netizens should update their Flash installations as soon as possible. "This is a type confusion bug that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a target system," the Zero Day Initiative warned in an advisory

> "The attacker would need to entice an affected system to view maliciously crafted Flash content, typically hosted on a website

- This security update should be a high priority for administrators." It's a demoralizing blow for Adobe, which just last week proudly trumpeting the fact that  for the first time in ages  there would be no security patches this month for its applications

- Sadly, that lasted six days before the emergency fix had to be released.  'Israel hacked Kaspersky and caught Russian spies using AV tool to harvest NSA exploits' READ MORE Kaspersky researcher Anton Ivanov uncovered the flaw on October 10 while investigating a hacker called BlackOasis  who last year exploited another zero-day bug in Flash to infect computers with copies of the leaked FinFisher aka FinSpy government surveillance tools. Forward to this month, and Ivanov spotted BlackOasis exploiting a previously unheard-of bug in Flash to execute arbitrary malicious code on a machine

- The booby-trapped Flash file is wrapped in an ActiveX object, and embedded in Microsoft Office documents that are presumably emailed to victims

- Once opened, the Flash file exploits the memory-corruption bug to read and write memory as it pleases, which is used to execute an initial shellcode stage.

## Google isn't saying Microsoft security sucks but Chrome for Windows has its own antivirus

-  In its ongoing effort to improve browser security, school Microsoft on security, and retain its search audience, Google is today rolling out several Chrome for Windows fortifications. The search biz has modded Chrome for Windows to detect when extensions switch people's Chrome settings, such as the default search engine, without authorization, a common tactic for deceptive software

- The browser will now ask whether it can restore previous settings, which for the majority of Windows users will reestablish Google as Chrome's default search engine. The operation can also be done by visiting a reset URL:  chrome://settings/resetProfileSettings What's more, Google has enlisted security biz ESET to rebuild its Chrome Cleanup engine for removing deceptive code

- In effect, the browser is getting built-in basic antivirus protection for your Windows computer. "Our engine scans for and cleans potentially harmful applications, specifically the types that negatively impact or target the Chrome browsing experience," said Juraj Malcho, chief technology officer at ESET, in an email to The Register

> "It is not meant to provide full coverage against all modern threats, its capabilities are limited to detecting specific malware families and/or specific ways of tampering with Chrome or operating system." Chrome Cleanup began life in 2014 as Software Removal Tool, a sort of factory reset for Google's browser

- Referred to as both Chrome Cleanup Tool and Chrome Cleanup, it has evolved into a way for Windows users to undo the damage from "unwanted software," the neutered term Google uses for malware. "Unwanted software" emphasizes desirability, or lack thereof, rather than responsibility

- The web giant takes a similar tack by referring to ad fraud as "invalid clicks." It also uses the defanged phrase "potentially harmful apps," or PHAs, in lieu of something stronger. In its Android Security 2016 Year in Review report, Google said it employs the term "unwanted software" as "a way to deal with applications that are not strictly considered malware, but are generally harmful to the software ecosystem." For what it's worth, Chrome, by default, automatically tries to stop software nasties from being accidentally downloaded onto a machine, by checking website URLs against lists of known dangerous and unsafe sites

- If you surf to a website known for distributing malware, er, unwanted software, a big red warning will appear in the browser urging you to stop and go back the way you came.  Microsoft flips Google the bird after Windows kernel bug blurt READ MORE However, this kind of prevention isn't perfect, because new evil sites pop up all the time and may not be on the blacklist immediately, and so now Chrome has its own proper builtin antivirus for catching and removing particular types of malicious code, if that code manages to run on a machine. And here's why Google opts for "unwanted software" rather than "malware." To avoid any arguments or court battles over accusations of wrongdoing, rather than label a dodgy application as "malware," Google opts for no-fault removals, without apology, blame or recompense

- It's not removing illegal or deliberately malicious software from your computer, it's removing unwanted software. Semantics aside, the tweaked Chrome Cleanup sports a revised interface for more clearly communicating what will be removed

## Never mind the WPA2 drama... Details emerge of TPM key cockup that hits tonnes of devices

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/l1J3C3oLFQbwy8Ovm/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc999945334b4e77ffc2e2)

-  RSA keys produced by smartcards, security tokens, laptops, and other devices using cryptography chips made by Infineon Technologies are weak and crackable  and should be regenerated with stronger algorithms. In short, Infineon TPMs  aka trusted platform modules  are used in countless computers and gadgets to generate RSA key pairs for securing VPNs, implementing trusted boot sequences, performing whole disk encryption, granting access to cloud accounts, producing encryption certificates, and more

- The secrets at the heart of these systems can be mathematically cracked by determined adversaries, allowing them to potentially gain control of computers and decipher data secured by the TPM-built RSA keys. We've previously covered the firmware bug on these pages

- Now, while everyone's distracted by the WPA2 KRACK flaw, a few more details of the Infineon screwup have emerged, and you should check them out to make sure you're not affected or take action if so

- For example, the bug causes some Yubikey 4 gadgets to generate weak authentication keys, and should be replaced as soon as possible. Essentially, you should upgrade your TPM's firmware, via updates from your device's manufacturer or operating system's maker, as soon as possible, and refresh your weak keys using the new code on the hardware or using a stronger implementation. Crypto expert Thomas Ptacek had this to say:  The Infineon bug is a bigger deal than the WiFi bug.  Thomas H

- Ptacek (@tqbf) October 16, 2017  Meanwhile: well be checking RSA keys for this stupid Infineon prime search bug for the next 10 years.  Thomas H

- Ptacek (@tqbf) October 16, 2017 The TPM vulnerability can be exploited to compute, by factorization, the private keys from public keys in TPM-generated RSA private-public key pairs

- Suffice to say, this shouldn't be possible, and the private component is supposed to remain secret. The bug lies in the chipset's firmware code that generates key pairs, and was discovered by a team of researchers at Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic; UK security firm Enigma Bridge; and Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Italy

- Infineon security chips manufactured from 2012 onwards, including the latest versions, are all vulnerable. We're told you'll need somewhere in the region of $30,000 in cloud computing power to crack a 2,048-bit RSA key pair generated by the dodgy Infineon hardware

## Telegram is preparing to fight the Russian authorities over crypto keys

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/ya4eevXU490Iw/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc999a656551696b43bde2)

-         The encrypted messaging app Telegram continues to have a tough time in Russia

- Having previously been threatened with blockage for not providing operational information, Telegram has now been hit with a significant fine  and ordered to hand over the encryption keys that led to the fine in the first place. Early on Monday, a court in Moscows Meshchansky district ordered Telegram to pay a fine of 800,000 rubles (around $14,000) for refusing to give the FSB state security agency the keys to decrypt users correspondence

- The so-called Yarovaya law  a package of anti-terrorism measures that was passed last year  requires the providers of messaging services to give the FSB access to users encrypted communications. According to an Interfax report, the FSB asked Telegram in July for information about six phone numbers, but Telegram did not respond. Telegram chief Pavel Durov, who is also well-known as the founder of the popular Russian social network VK, insists that the Yarovaya law is itself not legally valid

- In a Monday post on VK, Durov said the FSBs requirements are at odds with Article 23 of the Russian Federations constitution, which promises people that they have the right to privacy of correspondence and other communications. Durov said Telegram will appeal the ruling until the FSB lawsuit is heard by a judge familiar with the basic law of Russia. He also requested that lawyers who might want to take on the case should get in touch, as he will put together a legal team in the next couple of days to fight the case. So what happened with that operational information that could have led to Telegrams blockage? In that case, Durov backed down and agreed to register Telegram with Russian censors  though he refused to comply with demands to retain records of user data. As Durov pointed out at the time, the blockage of Telegram in Russia would simply have meant that its 10 million users in the country would have to send their secret correspondence through U.S.-based channels such as WhatsApp, or through the Israeli Viber

- Telegram is apparently popular with some senior Russian officials, such as Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Russia isnt the only country that has a beef with Durov

- The authorities in Iran filed a lawsuit against him late last month on the basis that Telegram was a platform for the activities of organized criminal groups ranging from ISIS to child pornographers and traffickers of drugs and people. Telegram is widely used in Iran  by 40 million people, Durov has claimed  and was reportedly instrumental in the organization of support for the election of the relatively moderate president Hassan Rouhani

- However, the hardline judiciary is very keen to block it. Last month Durov said that being denied entry into Russia occasionally would be more painful for him than his inability to visit Iran, primarily because it would affect his ability to visit his parents. Durov left Russia in 2014 after VK was gradually taken over by Kremlin-linked oligarchs and investment funds

- He went on to found Telegram in Berlin with his brother Nikolai.

## Oracle Fixes 20 Remotely Exploitable Java SE Vulns

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/xauWdmeNN41I4/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc999d496f67526b6c9979)

- Quarterly update for October is the smallest of the year: only 252 flaws to fix! Oracle advises to apply patches 'without delay.' Oracle this week urged administrators to apply security patches to their systems more quickly even as it increased their burden with a set of fresh fixes for another 252 vulnerabilities across products including Oracle Database Server and Java SE. Tuesday's critical patch update (CPU) is Oracle's first since news of the Equifax breach and of serious vulnerabilities in the widely used WPA2 WiFi security protocol, and separately, in numerous products featuring a particular crypto chipset from Infineon. In its patch availability announcement, Oracle did not specifically call out these incidents as heightening the urgency for organizations to apply its CPU's more promptly

- Instead as it usually does, Oracle more generally cautioned customers about periodic reports it receives about intruders successfully breaking into organizations by exploiting vulnerabilities for which the company has already issued patches. "Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay," the company noted. Big as October's CPU is, it is actually smaller than Oracle's last one in July when the company announced fixes for 310 flaws and the one before in April that involved patches for 300 vulnerabilities. Commenting on the security update, application security vendor Waratek said the CPU contains fixes for bugs in the Java Virtual Machine and five additional components in Oracle's Database Server

- Two of the patched flaws are remotely exploitable without the need for any credentials. Oracle's October CPU also patches 22 Java SE vulnerabilities, says Chris Goettl, product manager at Ivanti

- "Twenty of these may be remotely exploited without requiring authentication," Goettl says. "What this means is an attacker with a foothold in your environment just needs to be able to resolve a system with one of these vulnerabilities exposed and they would not even need to have a credential to exploit it." Unlike Microsoft's monthly updates, Oracle releases its security patches once every three months

- So the October update is the last one for this year

- Up to now in 2017, Oracle has fixed a total of 79 vulnerabilities in Java SE or more than double the 37 it addressed last year, Waratek noted

- The sharp increase suggests that Oracle is paying more attention to find flaws in Java SE

- But it also underscores the growing risk that the Java platform poses for organizations, the vendor observed in its commentary. While smaller than recent CPUs, there are very important updates included in this critical patch such as patches that fix the serialization flaws," Waratek security architect Apostolos Giannakidis said in the guide

## Exploiting Weak Crypto on Car Key Fobs

-  [tomwimmenhove] has found a vulnerability in the cryptographic algorithm that is used by certain Subaru key fobs and he has open-sourced the software that drives this exploit

- All you need to open your Subaru is a RasPi and a DVB-T dongle, so you could complain that sharing this software equates to giving out master keys to potential car thieves

- On the other hand, this only works for a limited number of older models from a single manufacturer  its lacking in compatibility and affordability when compared to the proverbial brick. This hack is much more useful as a case study than a brick is, however, and [tomwimmenhove]s work points out some bad design on the manufacturers side and as such can help you to avoid these kind of mistakes

- The problem of predictable keys got great treatment in the comments of our post about an encryption scheme for devices low in power and memory, for instance. Those of you interested in digital signal processing may also want to take a look at his code, where he implements filtering, demodulation and decoding of the key fobs signal

- The transmission side is handled by rpitx and attacks against unencrypted communications with this kind of setup have been shown here before

- Theres a lot going on here thats much more interesting than stealing cars. [Via Bleeping Computer]

## MSI support for PCI device pass-through with stub domains

![lurl](https://media1.giphy.com/media/BoGbCkfklPumY/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99a2334b326d321a2da9)

-  Introduction In this post, we will describe how we fixed MSI support for VMs running in HVM mode in Qubes 4.0

- First, allow us to provide some background about the MSI feature and why we need it in the first place. In Qubes 4.0, we switched from paravirtualized (PV) virtual machines to hardware virtual machines (HVMs, also known as fully virtualized or hardware-assisted VMs) for improved security (see the 4.0-rc1 announcement for details)

- For VMs running as HVMs, Xen requires software that can emulate hardware (such as network cards) called QEMU in order to provide device emulation

- By default, Xen runs QEMU in the most trusted domain, dom0, and QEMU has quite a large attack surface

- Running QEMU in dom0 would jeopardize the security of Qubes, so it is necessary to run QEMU outside of dom0. We do this by using a Xen feature that allows us to run QEMU inside a second helper VM called a stub domain.* This way, an attacker who exploits a bug in QEMU will be confined to the stub domain rather than getting full access to dom0

- Admittedly, stub domains run in PV mode, which means that an attacker who were to successfully exploit QEMU would gain the ability to exploit potential Xen bugs in paravirtualization

- Nonetheless, we believe using HVMs to host PCI devices is still a considerable improvement

- Of course, in the long term, we would like to switch to using PVH VMs, but at the moment this is not feasible. In our testing, we found that pass-through PCI devices did not work in HVMs on some machines

## A working modem using HTML5 sound

-   Martin Kirkholt Melhus's workplace bans connecting his development computer to the internet, so he hacked together a modem using HTML5: by plugging over-the-ear headphones into his laptop's 3.5mm audio jack and then placing the headphones over a network-connected built-in mic, he is able to tunnel a network connection outside the firewall (or that's the theory; as he notes, "This was only ever intended as a gimmick and a proof of concept - not something that I would actually use at work.")    The code for it is on Github.   Lately, I've been working with a client where my development computer is not connected to the Internet

- This is a huge inconvenience, as the unavailability of Google and Stack Overflow vastly impact my productivity

- Only recently have I begun to grasp how much of my time is actually spent copy/pasting between Visual Studio and the browser.  My office also features an Internet connected laptop and my development computer expose 3,5 mm jack sockets for audio devices

- And thus my problems can be solved! Here's how I made a modem for closing the gap with Web Audio.  PS If you just want to try the modem already, head over to the live demo

## Deep Dive into Intel Management Engine Disablement

![lurl](https://media1.giphy.com/media/4PuHxplO8XuyA/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99a577544b54597f8898)

-   Hardware enablement developer  Latest posts by Youness Alaoui (see all)  Deep dive into Intel Management Engine disablement - October 19, 2017   Coreboot and Skylake, part 2: A Beautiful Game! - August 29, 2017   Coreboot on the Librem 13 v2, part 1 - June 15, 2017   Starting today, our second generation of laptops (based on the 6th gen Intel Skylake platform) will now come with the Intel Management Engine neutralized and disabled by default

- Users who already received their orders can also update their flash to disable the ME on their machines. In this post, I will dig deeper and explain in more details what this means exactly, and why it wasnt done before today for the laptops that were shipping this spring and summer. The life and times of the ME Think of the ME as having 4 possible states:   Fully operational ME: the ME is running normally like it does on other manufacturers machines (note that this could be a consumer or corporate ME image, which vary widely in the features they provide) Neutralized ME: the ME is neutralized/neutered by removing the most mission-critical components from it, such as the kernel and network stack. Disabled ME: the ME is officially disabled and is known to be completely stopped and non-functional Removed ME: the ME is completely removed and doesnt execute anything at any time, at all.  In my previous blog post about taming the ME, we discussed how we neutralize the ME (note that this was on the first generation, Broadwell-based Purism laptops back then), but weve taken things one step further today by not only neutralizing the ME but also by disabling it

- The difference between the two might not be immediately visible to some of you, so Ill clarify below.  A neutralized ME is a ME image which had most of its code removed.  The way the ME firmware is packaged on the flash, is in the form of multiple modules, and each module has a specific task, such as : Hardware initialization, Firmware updates, Kernel, Network stack, Audio/Video processing, HECI communication over PCI, Java virtual machine, etc

- When the ME is neutralized using the me_cleaner tool, most of the modules will be removed

- As weve seen on Broadwell, that meant almost 93% of the code is removed and only 7% remains (that proportion is different on Skylake, see further below). A neutralized ME means that the ME firmware will encounter an error during its regular boot cycle; It will not find some of its critical modules and it will throw an error and somehow fail to proceed

- However, the ME remains operational, it just cant do anything valuable

- While its unable to communicate with the main CPU through the HECI commands, the PCI interface to the ME processor is still active and lets us poke at the status of the ME for example, which lets us see which error caused it to stop functioning.   When the ME is disabled using the HAP method (thanks to the Positive Technologies for discovering this trick), however, it doesnt throw an error because it cant load a module: it actually stops itself in a graceful manner, by design.  The two approaches are similar in that they both stop the execution of the ME during the hardware initialization (BUP) phase, but with the ME disabled through the HAP method, the ME stops on its own, without putting up a fight, potentially disabling things that the forceful me_cleaner approach, with the unexpected error state, wouldnt have disabled

- The PCI interface for example, is entirely unable to communicate with the ME processor, and the status of the ME is not even retrievable. So the big, visible difference for us, between a neutralized and a disabled ME, is that the neutralized ME might appear normal when coreboot accesses its status, or it might show that it has terminated due to an error, while a disabled ME simply doesnt give us a status at allso coreboot will even think that the ME partition is corrupted

## Purism Librem Laptops Completely Disable Intels Management Engine

-  SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., October 19, 2017  Purisms Librem Laptops, running coreboot, are now available with the Intel Management Engine completely and verifiably disabled. Disabling the Management Engine, long believed to be impossible, is now possible and available in all current Librem laptops, it is also available as a software update for previously shipped recent Librem laptops. says Todd Weaver, Founder  CEO of Purism. The Management Engine (ME), part of Intel AMT, is a separate CPU that can run and control a computer even when powered off

- The ME has been the bane of the security market since 2008 on all Intel based CPUs, with publicly released exploits against it, is now disabled by default on all Purism Librem laptops. Disabling the Management Engine is no easy task, and it has taken security researchers years to find a way to properly and verifiably disable it

- Purism, because it runs coreboot and maintains its own BIOS firmware update process has been able to release and ship coreboot that disables the Management Engine from running, directly halting the ME CPU without the ability of recovery. Purism Librem laptops were already the most secure current Intel based computers available on the market today, but disabling the management engine solidifies that statement clearly. says Zlatan Todoric, CTO of Purism. The Librem 13 and Librem 15 products can be purchased today and will arrive with the Management Engine disabled by default, and it can be verified to be disabled with the source code released to confirm the disablement is accurate

- Showing ME: FW Partition Table : BAD; ME: Bringup Loader Failure : YES Purism, in the long-term pursuit of liberating hardware at the lowest levels, still has more work to do

- Removing the management engine entirely is the next step beyond just disabling it

- Coreboot also includes another binary, the Intel FSP, a less worrisome but still important binary to liberate, incorporating a free vBIOS is another step Purism plans to take

- The road to a completely free system on current Intel CPUs is not over, but the largest step of disabling the Management Engine is arguably the largest milestone to cross. says Youness Alaoui, Hardware Enablement Developer at Purism. See also: our technical write-up on disabling the Management Engine on Purism laptops. About Purism Purism is a Social Purpose Corporation devoted to bringing security, privacy, software freedom, and digital independence to everyones personal computing experience

## These Giant Printers Are Meant to Make Rockets

-  Tim Ellis and Jordan Noone are both in their mid-20s, and it shows

- The two aerospace engineers are energetic, optimistic, and so ambitious they cant help sounding a little bonkers.In a small factory a couple of miles from Los Angeles International Airport, Ellis and Noone have spent the past two years working to build a rocket using only 3D printers

- Their startup, Relativity Space Inc., is betting that removing humans from the manufacturing equation will make rockets way cheaper and faster to produce

- The going rate for a rocket launch is about $100 million; Relativity says that in four years its price will be $10 million

- This is the right direction, says Ellis, the chief executive officer, during the first-ever press tour of the companys headquarters

- The 3D printing and automation of rockets is inevitable.That direction is less obvious than he makes it sound

- Although a couple of companies have 3D-printed whole rocket engines and other parts to make them more durable (molten metal shaped into a single part is less vulnerable to wear and tear than a bunch of pieces fitted together), 3D printing tends to be slower and more expensive than old-fashioned welding

- Faced with that problem, Relativity decided the solution was to build its own printers. How to Get to Space on the Cheap The printers, among the largest ever, consist of 18-foot-tall robotic arms equipped with lasers that can melt a steady stream of aluminum wire into liquid metal for shaping

## Security flaws in smartwatches for children

-  The Norwegian Consumer Council has uncovered serious security and privacy flaws in smartwatches for children

- Strangers can easily seize control of the watches and use them to track and eavesdrop on children.Together with the security firm Mnemonic, the Norwegian Consumer Council tested several smartwatches for children

- Our findings are alarming

- We discovered significant security flaws, unreliable safety features and a lack of consumer protection. Its very serious when products that claim to make children safer instead put them at risk because of poor security and features that do not work properly, says Finn Myrstad, Director of Digital Policy at the Norwegian Consumer Council. Importers and retailers must know what they stock and sell

- These watches have no place on a shops shelf, let alone on a childs wrist.  The Consumer Council is referring the manufacturers to the Norwegian Data Protection Authority and the Consumer Ombudsman for breaches of the Norwegian Personal Data Act and the Marketing Control Act

- These legal acts are based on the EUs Data Protection Directive and the Directive on unfair terms in consumer contracts, and thus constitutes a breach of EU law

- The watches are available in multiple EU member states (see below for an overview). The watches have continued to be actively promoted after the Norwegian, European, and international contact points of the companies were warned of the findings. Numerous failings Serious security flaws  Through a few simple steps, a stranger can take control of the watch and track, eavesdrop on and communicate with the child

- They will be able to track the child as it moves or make it look like the child is somewhere it is not

- Row-hammer is hardware bug that can cause bit-flips in physical RAM

- Mark Seaborn and Thomas Dullien were the first to exploit the DRAM row-hammer bug to gain kernel privileges

- Kaveh Razavi et al. pushed the exploitation of row-hammer bugs to the next level

- They abused an OS feature  memory de-duplication  to surgically flip bits in a controlled way

- They succeeded in flipping bits in memory loaded sensitive files (e.g

- authorized_keys) assuming they know their contents

- By weakening RSA moduli in authorized_keys file, they were able to generate corresponding private keys and authenticate on a co-hosted victim VM.In this post, we aim to showcase a different attack scenario

- Instead of corrupting memory loaded files, we chose to corrupt the state of a running program

## BoundHook Attack Exploits Intel Skylake MPX Feature

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/3o6UB65bfF8P1anIZ2/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99b164567a7a2ed84512)

- A post-intrusion technique developed by researchers at CyberArk Labs called BoundHooking allows attackers to exploit a feature in all Intel chips introduced since Skylake

- The attack technique allows for the execution of code from any process without detection by antivirus software or other security measures, researchers said. According to CyberArk, a BoundHooking attack exploits the Intel feature called Memory Protection Extension (MPX) to hook function calls that pass between software components

- That allows for an adversary to manipulate and spy on a wide range of Windows applications.Related Posts   Necurs-Based DDE Attacks Now Spreading Locky Ransomware   October 20, 2017 , 12:05 pm     Threatpost News Wrap, Oct

- 20, 2017   October 20, 2017 , 10:15 am     Factorization Flaw in TPM Chips Makes Attacks on RSA Private Keys Feasible   October 16, 2017 , 2:05 pm    Some of the software that utilizes hooks include: application security solutions, system utilities, tools for programming, malicious software and others, said Kasif Dekel security researcher at CyberArk. Dekel said the prerequisite for its proof-of-concept attack are the presence of an Intel CPU (Skylake or after) running MPX concurrently with Windows 10 (64-bit or 32-bit)

- Adversaries must also have already fully compromised the targeted system. The beauty of these type attacks is that an adversarys actions can go undetected, said Doron Naim, senior security researcher at CyberArk. Researchers said the BoundHook technique, explained in a technical report released Wednesday, is able to cause an exception in a specific memory location in a user-mode context

- Next, it is able to catch the exception and gain control over the thread execution used by a specific application

- For example, the technique could allow for the interception of a keyboard event message passed between Windows and a specific service, allowing an attacker to capture or manipulate a victims keystrokes. The technique is similar a proof-of-concept attack explained earlier this year by CyberArk called GhostHook

- That technique bypassed Microsofts PatchGuard kernel protection in Windows 10 via the Intel feature Processor Trace

- It's regularly cracked within a day. If Denuvo can no longer provide even a single full day of protection from cracks, though, that protection is going to look a lot less valuable to publishers

- But that doesn't mean Denuvo will stay effectively useless forever

- The company has updated its DRM protection methods with a number of "variants" since its rollout in 2014, and chatter in the cracking community indicates a revamped "version 5" will launch any day now

- That might give publishers a little more breathing room where their games can exist uncracked and force the crackers back to the drawing board for another round of the never-ending DRM battle. BoingBoing post

## Malware hidden in vid app is so nasty, victims should wipe their Macs

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/1xbHamj1csLAc/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99b5726f51485544cffd)

-  It's going to be an unpleasant weekend for some Mac users who are facing a complete system wipe and reinstall  after hackers stashed malware in legitimate applications. Eltima Software, which makes the popular Elmedia Player and download manager Folx, today confessed the latest versions of those two apps came with an unwelcome extra  the rather horrid OSX.Proton malware. The software nasty, which was injected into downloads of the applications, was spotted by security shop ESET, which alerted Elmedia

- A subsequent investigation revealed miscreants had got into the developer's servers, implanted the malware into the download files, and then let the company infect its users as they fetched the software. Proton is a remote-control trojan designed specifically for Mac systems

- It opens a backdoor granting root-level command-line access to commandeer the computer, and can steal passwords, encryption and VPN keys, and crypto-currencies from infected systems

- It can gain access to a victim's iCloud account, even if two-factor authentication is used, and went on sale in March with a $50,000 price tag. The malware was clocked by ESET in new downloads of the applications on October 19, and removed by Eltima by 3.10pm PDT that day

- If you were already using the software and simply updated it, you should be malware free, but just in case, do a scan for the following files:  /tmp/Updater.app/ /Library/LaunchAgents/com.Eltima.UpdaterAgent.plist /Library/.rand/ /Library/.rand/updateragent.app/  If any of those exist, then you've got Proton on your computer

- While the malware is recognized by antivirus packages, it's particularly persistent and difficult to remove

- Eltima's advice is to nuke the entire site from orbit, it's the only way to be sure. "A total system OS reinstall is the only guaranteed way to totally rid your system of this Malware," it warned

> "This is a standard procedure for any system compromise with the affection of administrator account." Have a good weekend

-  Intel ME is a coprocessor integrated in all post-2006 Intel boards, for which this Libreboot page has an excellent description

- The main component of Intel ME is Intel AMT, and I suggest you to read this Wikipedia page for more information about it

- In short, Intel ME is an irremovable environment with an obscure signed proprietary firmware, with full network and memory access, which poses a serious security threat

- Even when disabled from the BIOS settings, Intel ME is active: the only way to be sure it is disabled is to remove its firmware from the flash chip. Before Nehalem (ME version 6, 2008/2009) the ME firmware could be removed completely from the flash chip by setting a couple of bits inside the flash descriptor, without the need to reverse-engineer the ME firmware. Starting from Nehalem the Intel ME firmware can't be removed anymore: without a valid firmware the PC shuts off forcefully after 30 minutes

- This project is an attempt to remove as much code as possible from such firmware without falling into the 30 minutes recovery mode. me_cleaner currently works on most architectures, see me_cleaner status (or its discussion) for more info about them

- me_cleaner works also on the TXE and SPS firmware. If you want to understand how me_cleaner works, you can read the "How does it work?" page. If you want to apply me_cleaner on your platform I suggest you to read the "How does it work?" page and then follow the guide "How to apply me_cleaner". For pre-Skylake firmware (ME version  11) this tool removes almost everything, leaving only the two fundamental modules needed for the correct boot, ROMP and BUP

- The code size is reduced from 1.5 MB (non-AMT firmware) or 5 MB (AMT firmware) to ~90 kB of compressed code. Starting from Skylake (ME version = 11) the ME subsystem and the firmware structure have changed, requiring substantial changes in me_cleaner

- The fundamental modules required for the correct boot are now four (rbe, kernel, syslib and bup) and the minimum code size is ~300 kB of compressed code (from the 2 MB of the non-AMT firmware and the 7 MB of the AMT one). This project is based on the work of the community; in particular I thank Igor Skochinsky, for the core information about Intel ME and its firmware structure, and Federico Amedeo Izzo, for its help during the study of Intel ME.

## Android getting "DNS over TLS" support to stop ISPs from knowing what websites you visit

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/h2LD1U2FBCi0U/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99b84368676863e817c7)

-  Android getting DNS over TLS support to stop ISPs from knowing what websites you visit A DNS (Domain Name Server) is what translates a website address from a URL that you enter to an IP address which your computer actually connects to

- For example, when you type www.xda-developers.com into your browser, your computer queries a DNS which looks up and returns the IP address 209.58.128.90 to the client

- This process is hidden from the user, but every website you visit (so long as it has a human-readable URL) will go through this same process

- The problem for those security conscious out there is that these requests are done in plain text through UDP or TCP protocols which are readable by anyone that can see your connection, including your ISP

- This is where DNS over TLS comes in. DNS over TLS is a protocol where DNS queries will be encrypted to the same level as HTTPS and thus a DNS cant actually log or see the websites you visit

- This uses TLS, or Transport Layer Security, to achieve this encryption

- This does require the DNS you are using to have DNS over TLS support, though, but its a start

- Users can switch to Googles DNS if they wish to benefit from DNS over TLS. It appears that DNS over TLS support is being added to Android, according to several commits added to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP)

-   Theres a weird feeling afoot these days, in the Valley, and in San Francisco

- Across the rest of the world  Denver, Santiago, Toronto, Berlin, Silicon Glen, Silicon Alley, Silicon Roundabout, Station F  it seems every city still wants to be a startup hub, dreaming of becoming the new Silicon Valley. But in the Valley itself? Here it feels like the golden age of the startup is already over. Hordes of engineering and business graduates secretly dream of building the new Facebook, the new Uber, the new Airbnb

- Almost every big city now boasts one or more startup accelerators, modeled after Paul Grahams now-legendary Y Combinator

- Throngs of technology entrepreneurs are reshaping, disrupting, every aspect of our economy

- Todays big businesses are arthritic dinosaurs soon devoured by these nimble, fast-growing mammals with sharp teeth

- Right? Er, actually, no

- That was last decade

- We live in a new world now, and it favors the big, not the small

## DUHK Crypto Attack Recovers Encryption Keys, Exposes VPN Connections, More

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/3kQQZsghLUkne/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99ba724e504c4df37bda)

-   After last week we had the KRACK and ROCA cryptographic attacks, this week has gotten off to a similarly "great" start with the publication of a new crypto attack known as DUHK (Don't Use Hard-coded Keys). The issue at the heart of the DUHK attack is a combination of two main factors. The first is the usage of the ANSI X9.31 Random Number Generator (RNG)

- This is an algorithm that takes random data and generates encryption keys used to secure VPN connections, browsing sessions, and other encrypted traffic/data. The second factor needed for a DUHK attack is when hardware vendors use a hardcoded "seed key" for the ANSI X9.31 RNG algorithm

- Normally, vendors should generate a random seed key at device startup or before launching the ANSI X9.31 algorithm. This means that when you have hardware/software products that combine ANSI X9.31 and deploy a hardcoded seed key, attackers can decrypt encrypted communications carried out through that device

- This includes communications passing over VPN connections or encrypted web sessions that carry out login credentials, payment information, Intranet information, private enterprise data, and more. Old Fortinet FortiGate devices vulnerable to DUHK attacks The DUHK attack was discovered by two researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and one researcher from Johns Hopkins University. In a research paper they published today  entitled "Practical state recovery attacks against legacy RNG implementations"  researchers reveal they were able to recover encrypted traffic from Fortinet FortiGate devices used by companies across the world as firewalls or to create private VPN networks. The research team says they reversed engineered FortiGate firmware images and found the hard-coded seed key

- They then observed traffic coming from the affected device and using the seed key, they brute-forced encrypted data to guess the rest of the encryption parameters

- This, in turn, allowed them to determine the main encryption key. Fortinet FortiGate devices using FortiOS 4.3.0 to FortiOS 4.3.18 are vulnerable to DUHK attacks (CVE-2016-8492)

- FortiOS 5.x is not affected, while Fortinet removed the hard-coded seed key in FortiOS 4.3.19 after researchers contacted the company. At the time of their research, experts said they found over 23,000 older Fortinet 4.x devices exposed online

- This number could be greater, as some devices might be located on firewalled networks, but still vulnerable to attacks. DUHK attack takes up to 4 mins/connection The attack is not trivial, but researchers say it's practical as an attacker using a modern computer can recover the encryption key in around four minutes per connection. There is no user interaction needed to carry out a DUHK attack, as all the threat actor needs is a position to observe traffic coming from a vulnerable device

## SSH Escape Sequences (aka Kill Dead SSH Sessions) - The Lone Sysadmin

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/cUjlC121fx4BO/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99bb6b6e673545d98756)

-  Did you know that when youre using OpenSSH from the command line you have a variety of escape sequences available to you? SSH somewhere, then type ~ and ? (tilde, then question mark) to see all the options

- You should get something like: Supported escape sequences: ~

- - terminate connection (and any multiplexed sessions) ~B - send a BREAK to the remote system ~C - open a command line ~R - Request rekey (SSH protocol 2 only) ~^Z - suspend ssh ~# - list forwarded connections ~ - background ssh (when waiting for connections to terminate) ~? - this message ~~ - send the escape character by typing it twice Most commonly, I use tilde-period (~.) to close an unresponsive session, like when a firewall has closed my connection. BREAK is useful for various things, usually getting back to a terminal server console or getting the attention of network equipment. The command line doesnt do much, but you can alter forwards from it

- Ive never used it but its probably handy for troubleshooting if your tunnels arent working right: ssh ? Commands: -L[bind_address:]port:host:hostport Request local forward -R[bind_address:]port:host:hostport Request remote forward -D[bind_address:]port Request dynamic forward -KR[bind_address:]port Cancel remote forward Ive also never had to rekey a session for any reason, as SSH protocol version 2 does it automatically after a certain amount of data has been transferred

- You can mess with it via the RekeyLimit configuration directives, or read more about it in RFC 4344. Suspending SSH via tilde-Ctrl-Z is handy from time to time, especially when youre on the console of a machine that doesnt have screen or some other multiplexor on it (or you forgot to start one)

- Of course, you have to remember that when you need it, but now that youve read it maybe you will. List forwarded connections is handy for managing the forwards you might have created with the command line. Backgrounding SSH attempts to close all the connections, and will wait patiently for them to die

- I have never needed this, because Im the impatient bastard that just tilde-periods them if they dont close right away. You can use the EscapeChar configuration directive to change the tilde, if that conflicts with something

- Or you can just type it twice to send it.    Related

## TorPolice  A Novel Framework For Enforcing Access Control Policies Across the Tor Network

-  The Tor network represents the most popular anonymity network, which is currently used by millions of users all over the world

- Nevertheless, access control doesnt exist for users of the Tor network, which renders the network susceptible to malicious attacks and botnet abuse

- For instance, adversaries often exploit exit relay nodes utilizing them as stepping stones for various forms of malicious attacks, forcing service providers to use CAPTCHAs to exit relay nodes IP addresses or even blacklist them all, which results in major usability problems for honest Tor users. To mitigate this problem, a group of researchers recently proposed TorPolice; the first ever framework for preservation of privacy access control for Tor

- TorPolice works via enabling abuse plagued service providers, e.g

- Yelp, to implement access rules to police and suppress malicious requests conveyed via the Tor network, while still offering network services to honest Tor users

- Even more so, TorPolice endows Tor with universal access control for relay nodes; thus, maximizing Tors immunity against botnet attacks

- The developers of the framework tested a prototype of TorPolice which proved that it can greatly improve the privacy of users of the Tor network.  The Design Goals of TorPolice: TorPolice acts via adding access control to the anonymous connections taking place over the Tor network, which is beneficial to both service providers, as well as the Tor network itself

- Apart from previously proposed capability based frameworks, TorPolices structure is designed to mitigate three challenges;  Preservation of the anonymity of Tors users. Prevention of creation of central control points. Creation of an incrementally implementable framework.  Service defined access policies: Almost 70% of all exit relay nodes across the Tor network are listed as comment spammers by Project Honey Pot, which caused a large number of service providers and content delivery networks (CDNs) to filter and block network traffic emerging from Tor

## Cryptology ePrint Archive: Report 2017/1014

-  Attacking Deterministic Signature Schemes using Fault Attacks Damian Poddebniak and Juraj Somorovsky and Sebastian Schinzel and Manfred Lochter and Paul Rosler Abstract: Many digital signature schemes rely on random numbers that are unique and non-predictable per signature

- Failures of random number generators may have catastrophic effects such as compromising private signature keys

- In recent years, many widely-used cryptographic technologies adopted deterministic signature schemes because they are presumed to be safer to implement

-  In this paper, we analyze the security of deterministic ECDSA and EdDSA signature schemes and show that the elimination of random number generators in these schemes enables new kinds of fault attacks

- We formalize these attacks and introduce practical attack scenarios against EdDSA using the Rowhammer fault attack

- EdDSA is used in many widely used protocols such as TLS, SSH and IPSec, and we show that these protocols are not vulnerable to our attack

- We formalize the necessary requirements of protocols using these deterministic signature schemes to be vulnerable, and discuss mitigation strategies and their effect on fault attacks against deterministic signature schemes

-  A plastic surgery clinic frequented by celebrities such as Katie Price has been targeted by hackers. London Bridge Plastic Surgery confirmed in a statement that it has been the victim of a cyber attack. Hackers using the name The Dark Overlord claimed to be behind the breach, which they said included stealing "terabytes" of data, The Daily Beast reported. The news site, which has seen the images, says many are highly graphic and close-up, showing surgery on male and female genitalia

> "Others show apparent patients' bodies post-operation, and some include faces," it reported. The group claims that its stolen cache contains information on "royal families" and has said it will distribute the patient list and corresponding photos online. "We took measures to block the attack immediately in order to protect patient information and we informed the Metropolitan Police who launched an investigation," the clinic told The Daily Beast in a statement. "Regrettably, following investigations by our IT experts and the police, we believe that our security was breached and that data has been stolen

- We are still working to establish exactly what data has been compromised." The clinic said it is "horrified that they have now targeted our patients", adding: "Security and patient confidentiality has always been of the utmost importance to us

- We invest in market-leading technology to keep our data secure and our systems are updated daily

- We are deeply saddened that our security has been breached. "We are profoundly sorry for any distress this data breach may cause our patients and our team are available around the clock to speak to anyone who has any concerns by calling 0203 858 0664." A police spokesperson told The Daily Beast: "On Tuesday, 17 October the Metropolitan Police Service was informed of a data theft from a cosmetic surgery clinic in London

- Detectives from the Met's Organised Crime Command are investigating

- There have been no arrests and enquires are ongoing."

## Congress votes to disallow consumers from suing Equifax

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/l46CC4WjzHe4RcX2E/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99c34f5234487303efec)

-   The Senate voted late Tuesday night to strike a federal rule that would have allowed consumers affected by the Equifax hack to sue the company

- Without it, the millions affected by the historic security breach may be disallowed from related joining class action lawsuits

- This specific rule, and only this rule, would be nullified if the joint resolution is signed by the President. The vote was 50/50, with the tie-breaking yea cast by Vice President Pence. The rule in question was entered into the Federal Register by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection in July; it prevents financial companies that bind their users by arbitration agreements from prohibiting those same users from suing as a class. The final rule prohibits covered providers of certain consumer financial products and services from using an agreement with a consumer that provides for arbitration of any future dispute between the parties to bar the consumer from filing or participating in a class action concerning the covered consumer financial product or service. Thats exactly like what the terms of Equifaxs services included when users went to the companys site to see if they were affected by the hack

- Although the site in question appears to have been essentially useless, it shunted users into an Equifax-provided service with terms that bound disputes to be resolved via arbitration. Equifax later modified some of its terms to remove the arbitration clause, and also indicated in its TrustedID service FAQ that the clause applies to the free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection products, and not the cybersecurity incident. Nevertheless, its very unclear just what users may or may not have signed up for, and to what degree Equifax is protected by these terms

- Arbitration agreements have been effective before in preventing class action lawsuits

- The BCFP rule was made to prevent major incidents like this one from having their legal repercussions partly nullified; H.J

- Res

- 111 was introduced on July 20, the day after the rule above was instituted

- You can read more about what a digital currency fork is here.We operate by the principle that our customers should benefit to the greatest extent possible from hard forks or other unexpected events

- This is essential in our mission to make Coinbase the most trusted, safe, and easy-to-use digital currency exchange.Bitcoin Segwit2xThe Bitcoin Segwit2x fork is projected to take place on November 16th and will temporarily result in two bitcoin blockchains

- Following the fork, Coinbase will continue referring to the current bitcoin blockchain as Bitcoin (BTC) and the forked blockchain as Bitcoin2x (B2X).Any customer with a BTC balance on Coinbase at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of the B2X asset on the Bitcoin2x blockchain. No action is required  we will automatically credit your account. So, if you have 5 BTC stored on Coinbase before the fork; you will have 5 BTC and 5 B2X following the event.For more information about Bitcoin2x please see our FAQ page.Bitcoin2x TimelineApproximately 24 hours pre-fork

- Coinbase will temporarily disable all bitcoin buy, sells, sends and receives

- ETH and LTC will not be impacted

- You will still be able to see your Bitcoin balances and monitor the price

- If you plan on moving BTC into your Coinbase account, we highly recommend that you do so at least 24 hours before the fork to ensure your transfers are confirmed.Fork (block 494,784)

## 'We've nothing to hide': Kaspersky Lab offers to open up source code

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/fhJVPzRZLy7Vm/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99ce6b62335155226d23)

-  Russian cybersecurity software flinger Kaspersky Lab has offered to open up its source code for third-party review. The firm's Global Transparency Initiative is in response to moves to ban the use of its technology on US government systems by the Department of Homeland Security over concerns of alleged ties with the Russian government. The initiative comes days after reports that Russian government hackers used Kaspersky antivirus software to siphon off classified material from a PC belonging to a NSA contractor.  With this initiative, Kaspersky Lab will engage the broader information security community and other stakeholders in validating and verifying the trustworthiness of its products, internal processes, and business operations, as well as introducing additional accountability mechanisms by which the company can further demonstrate that it addresses any security issues promptly and thoroughly.  An independent review of the company's source code by Q1 2018 will be followed by similar audits of its software updates and threat detection rules

- A separate independent assessment of Kaspersky Lab's secure development lifecycle processes and its software and supply chain risk mitigation strategies will take place in parallel. Analysis of source code to rule out possible backdoors is all well and good but what really counts is how anti-malware software is configured to select what types of file are uploaded to the cloud for further scrutiny

- The behaviour of the software can be and needs to be altered by updates. Kaspersky Lab further plans to open up three Transparency Centres worldwide (in Asia, Europe and the US) by 2020

- In the meantime, the company has increased the value of its bug bounty awards to up to 75,000 ($100,000) for the most severe vulnerabilities. Eugene Kaspersky, chairman and chief exec, said the initiative was designed to re-establish trust and prevent the "balkanisation" of internet security. "Cybersecurity has no borders, but attempts to introduce national boundaries in cyberspace is counterproductive and must be stopped," Kaspersky said in a statement

> "We need to re-establish trust in relationships between companies, governments and citizens

- That's why we're launching this Global Transparency Initiative: we want to show how we're completely open and transparent

- We've nothing to hide." Industry reaction has been mixed. Javvad Malik, security advocate at AlienVault, said: "Following the allegations against Kaspersky, the company needs to restore public trust and this is a good way to go about rebuilding that trust. "With an increase in cyber warfare and hostile governments, it makes sense for more companies to bring more transparency to the market

- So it could encourage other companies to follow suit and help technology companies remain politically agnostic. "This is particularly relevant to security companies whose software often runs with high privileges." Lee Munson, security researcher for Comparitech.com, argued that the move had more to do with reputation management than transparency. "However Kaspersky Lab packages this new initiative, it is clear to me that this is about reputation repair, especially in the US where claims of links to Russian intelligence agencies have been severely damaging. "That it could build trust in the security community is true, though the trust being built for Kaspersky is obviously of paramount importance here."

## WHOIS embarrassed about security? APNIC, after database leaks

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/vX9WcCiWwUF7G/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99cf396d76744d37180a)

-  Asia's internet numbers registry APNIC has apologised to network owners after a slip in its WHOIS database config leaked credentials, including weakly-hashed passwords. The breach affected those in the regional registry's Maintainer and Incident Response Team (IRT) database objects

- During a June 2017 upgrade, those details were included in downloadable WHOIS data. Maintainer is the administrative object that restricts who is allowed to edit other objects in the APNIC database; the IRT object identifies who receives abuse reports. Chris Barcellos of eBay's Red Team noticed the data on a third-party Website on October 12 and notified APNIC

- The registry's deputy general director Sanjaya* writes that the database configuration was fixed on October 13, and subsequently the relevant passwords were reset. Had an attacker been able to recover the passwords, they could have altered WHOIS information or hijacked IP address blocks. As this configuration guide shows, one of the hash options available is crypt-pw, a weak and easily-reversed hash because it can only handle eight-character passwords. APNIC says it hasn't found evidence of malicious activity as the result of the breach

- Had anybody altered the records, it would not have been permanent, since authoritative registry data is held internally by APNIC

-  * Sanjaya uses just one name.

## Coin Hive hacked via old password to move manic miners' Monero into miscreants' pockets

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/WUjGvQ46MiQ6c/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99d06f765a6d553064e4)

-  Monero miner maker Coin Hive was hacked so that websites using its code inadvertently redirected their generated cryptocurrency to miscreants  after the outfit forgot to change an old password. The team, which develops alt-coin mining JavaScript engines, said on Tuesday hackers had used an old Cloudflare account password to reconfigure coinhive.com's DNS settings

- This allowed the thieves to briefly redirect downloads of its crypto-mining code to a malicious version that was hardcoded to funnel mined cyber-cash to one particular user

- In other words, websites embedding Coin Hive's JavaScript were actually embedding a dodgy copy that stole any Monero created by their visitors' browsers. "The DNS records for coinhive.com have been manipulated to redirect requests for the coinhive.min.js to a third party server," it said in a blog post

> "This third party server hosted a modified version of the JavaScript file with a hardcoded site key

- This essentially let the attacker 'steal' hashes from our users." Coin Hive said it regularly changes its passwords and uses two-factor authentication on its main accounts, but its Cloudflare account was overlooked

- It thinks the password was the same one its team used on Kickstarter, which was hacked in February 2014 and the Cloudflare pass phrase hadn't been changed since.  More and more websites are mining crypto-coins in your browser to pay their bills, line pockets READ MORE The group said it was "deeply sorry," and will recompense users of its software

- The plan is to credit all site owners with an additional 12 hours of Monero mining based on their daily average hashrate

- One Monero coin, 1 XMR, is worth about $89 right now. The cockup highlights the dangers of reusing pass phrases and not setting up two-factor authentication for everything

## Google Play Protect is 'dead last' at detecting malware on Android

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/zjuEa8uwYL5O8/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99c47071616b2e0b00fc)

-  Last month, German software testing laboratory AV-Test threw malware at 20 Android antivirus systems  and now the results aren't particularly great for Google. Its Play Protect system, which is supposed block malicious apps from running on your handheld, was beaten by every other anti-malware vendor. When exposed to recent Android malware samples, six of the 20 software suites sampled correctly flagged every single one as evil and prevented them from running

- Eight more managed a 99 per cent or higher hit rate

- Google's own system, Play Protect, only detected 65.8 per cent of threats. When it came to analyzing AV-Test's reference set of older malware, the results were equally unimpressive

- Some 13 of the 20 packages scored 100 per cent detection rates, with all but Play Protect correctly identifying 93 per cent or higher of samples

- Google's code managed just 79.2 per cent.  Google sucks at own security ..

- Sad  Google's Play Protect system was introduced by the Chocolate Factory this summer, and it's the first time AV-Test has put it through its paces

- Google bills the software as "the ideal security blanket" for users of its mobile OS, however, the testing shows it may be worth getting a third-party duvet in the meantime. There could well be good reason for this kind of performance

- Play Protect bundled together a lot of different tools under one label  anti-malware defenses, and remote device lockdown and recovery  and it's possible that its engineers haven't quite worked out how it all plays nicely with each other, or the team is overstretched and underfunded. This has, in a way, happened before, with Microsoft trying to protect an operating system it was too busy bunging new features on to slow down and secure the code

## Blog :: Introducing transport layer security (TLS) in pure OCaml

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/dnrlK0zmXsIHm/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99d26f636d4645dbb455)

- Jul82014150Introducing transport layer security (TLS) in pure OCamlWe announce a beta release of ocaml-tls, a clean-slate implementation of Transport Layer Security (TLS) in OCaml. What is TLS? Transport Layer Security (TLS) is probably the most widely deployed security protocol on the Internet

- It provides communication privacy to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery

- Furthermore, it optionally provides authentication of the involved endpoints

- TLS is commonly deployed for securing web services (HTTPS), emails, virtual private networks, and wireless networks. TLS uses asymmetric cryptography to exchange a symmetric key, and optionally authenticate (using X.509) either or both endpoints

- It provides algorithmic agility, which means that the key exchange method, symmetric encryption algorithm, and hash algorithm are negotiated. TLS in OCaml Our implementation ocaml-tls is already able to interoperate with existing TLS implementations, and supports several important TLS extensions such as server name indication (RFC4366, enabling virtual hosting) and secure renegotiation (RFC5746). Our demonstration server runs ocaml-tls and renders exchanged TLS messages in nearly real time by receiving a trace of the TLS session setup

- If you encounter any problems, please give us feedback. ocaml-tls and all dependent libraries are available via OPAM (opam install tls)

- The source is available under a BSD license

- We are primarily working towards completeness of protocol features, such as client authentication, session resumption, elliptic curve and GCM cipher suites, and have not yet optimised for performance. ocaml-tls depends on the following independent libraries: ocaml-nocrypto implements the cryptographic primitives, ocaml-asn1-combinators provides ASN.1 parsers/unparsers, and ocaml-x509 implements the X509 grammar and certificate validation (RFC5280)

## Nitrokey Start Supports Elliptic Curves (ECC) | Nitrokey

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/Axqr1hNEmGJiw/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99d333536b7459e59e3a)

- RSA-2048 Becomes Increasingly Insecure For security reasons, the German Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt fur Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik or BSI) no longer recommends RSA keys with a length of 2048 bit be used after 2022

- This means that longer keys will need to come into use in the foreseeable future

- Assuming a period of use of five years, safer keys should already be being generated

- However, longer RSA keys with 3074 bit or 4096 bit are significantly slower

- For this reason Nitrokey Start (resp

- the underlying firmware Gnuk) has been supporting encryption by means of elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) for some time

- This method is considered to be just as secure for smaller key systems as longer RSA keys and is also considerably faster. Basics of Elliptic-Curve Cryptography In contrast to RSA, there are many different forms (so-called curves) of elliptic-curve cryptography

- Notably, the NSA was involved in the development of the NIST curves

## AI Model Fundamentally Cracks Captchas, Scientists Say

![lurl](https://media1.giphy.com/media/3ohjURFrrRpX4wJguA/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99d333536b7459dcbf38)

-      Enlarge this image       A representation of the letter A, which can be used to crack CAPTCHAs

-  Vicarious AI       Scientists say they have developed a computer model that fundamentally breaks through a key test used to tell a human from a bot. You've probably passed this test hundreds of times

- Text-based CAPTCHAs, a rough acronym for Completely Automated Public Turing Test To Tell Computers and Humans Apart, are groups of jumbled characters along with squiggly lines and other background noise

-  You might be asked to type in these characters before signing up for a newsletter, for example, or purchasing concert tickets

-  There are a staggering number of ways that letters can be rendered and jumbled together where it is usually intuitive for a human to read, but difficult for a computer

- The ability to crack CAPTCHAs has become a key benchmark for artificial intelligence researchers

-      Enlarge this image       Captcha code on a laptop

-  milindri/Getty Images/iStockphoto       Many have tried and seen some success  for example, a decade ago, Ticketmaster sued a tech company because it was able to bypass the CAPTCHA system and purchase concert tickets on a massive scale. But those previous attempts simply exploited weaknesses in a particular kind of CAPTCHA, which could be easily defended against with slight changes in the program, says Dileep George, the co-founder of the AI company Vicarious.     A new model, described in research published today in Science, fundamentally breaks the CAPTCHA's defenses by parsing the text more effectively than previous models with less training, George says

## US voting server in election security probe is mysteriously wiped

![lurl](https://media1.giphy.com/media/3oriO1027fKWrvj4yY/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99d42e4f444836181e36)

-  Analysis A computer at the center of a lawsuit digging into woeful cyber-security practices during the US presidential election has been wiped. The server in question is based in Georgia  a state that narrowly backed Donald Trump, giving him 16 electoral votes  and stored the results from the state's voting systems

- The deletion of its data makes analysis of whether the computer was compromised impossible to ascertain. There is good reason to believe that the computer may have been tampered with: it is 15 years old, and could have be harboring all sorts of exploitable software and hardware vulnerabilities

- No hard copies of the votes are kept, making the electronic copy the only official record. It is feared the machine may have been hacked by Russian agents, who have taken a keen interest in the 2016 White House race, or potentially any miscreant on the planet. While investigating the Kennesaw State University's Center for Election Systems, which oversees Georgia's voting system, last year, security researcher Logan Lamb found its system was misconfigured, exposing the state's entire voter registration records, multiple PDFs with instructions and passwords for election workers, and the software systems used to tally votes cast. "You could just go to the root of where they were hosting all the files and just download everything without logging in," he said

- He also noted the files had been indexed by Google, making them readily available to anyone looking in the right place. Despite Lamb letting the election center knows of his findings, the security holes were left unpatched for seven months

- He later went public after the US security services announced there had been a determined effort by the Russian government to sway the presidential elections, including looking at compromising electronic voting machines.  Let's have a look  In an effort to force the state to scrap the system, a number of Georgia voters bandied together and sued

- They asked for an independent security review of the server, expecting to find flaws that would lend weight to their argument for investment in a more modern and secure system. But emails released this week following a Freedom of Information Act request reveal that technicians at the election center deleted the server's data on July 7  just days after the lawsuit was filed. The memos reveal multiple references to the data wipe, including a message sent just last week from an assistant state attorney general to the plaintiffs in the case

- That same email also notes that backups of the server data were also deleted more than a month after the initial wipe  just as the lawsuit moved to a federal court. It is unclear who ordered the destruction of the data, and why, but they have raised yet more suspicions of collusion between the Trump campaign team, the Republican Party, and the Russian government. So far, everyone is claiming ignorance of the event

- A spokesperson for Georgias secretary of state, Brian Kemp, who is in overall charge, denied having anything to do with the decision

## Suicide Linux @ Things Of Interest

- You know how sometimes if you mistype a filename in Bash, it corrects your spelling and runs the command anyway? Such as when changing directory, or opening a file. I have invented Suicide Linux

- Any time - any time - you type any remotely incorrect command, the interpreter creatively resolves it into rm -rf / and wipes your hard drive. It's a game

- Like walking a tightrope

- You have to see how long you can continue to use the operating system before losing all your data. Update 2011-12-26 Suicide Linux now appears to be a genuine Debian package

- Good show! A video demonstration is available

- The reaction from the OS is actually rather underwhelming

- You'd think the OS would raise some fairly urgent errors if you went around deleting parts of it? Perhaps rm -rf / should be replaced with something with more verbose flags set

- That way, when you run a bad command, you are told immediately that things are being deleted and you have a fighting chance to cancel the operation before your system becomes inoperable

-  Android Studio is the official IDE for Android development, and includes everything you need to build Android apps. To get the latest version, click Help  Check for update (on Mac, Android Studio  Check for updates). Or you can download Android Studio here. 3.0 (October 2017) Android Studio 3.0.0 is a major release that includes a variety of new features and improvements.      macOS users: If you are updating an older version of Android Studio, you may encounter an update error dialog that says "Some conflicts were found in the installation area"

- Simply ignore this error and click Cancel to resume the installation

-  Android Plugin for Gradle 3.0.0 The new Android plugin for Gradle includes a variety of improvements and new features, but it primarily improves build performance for projects that have a large number of modules

- When using the new plugin with these large projects, you should experience the following:  Faster build configuration times due to new delayed dependency resolution. Variant-aware dependency resolution for only the projects and variants you are building. Faster incremental build times when applying simple changes to code or resources.  Note: These improvements required significant changes that break some of the plugin's behaviors, DSL, and APIs

- Upgrading to version 3.0.0 might require changes to your build files and Gradle plugins. This version also includes the following:  Support for Android 8.0. Support for building separate APKs based on language resources. Support for Java 8 libraries and Java 8 language features (without the Jack compiler). Support for Android Test Support Library 1.0 (Android Test Utility and Android Test Orchestrator). Improved ndk-build and cmake build speeds. Improved Gradle sync speed. AAPT2 is now enabled by default. Using ndkCompile is now more restricted

- You should instead migrate to using either CMake or ndk-build to compile native code that you want to package into your APK

- To learn more, read Migrate from ndkcompile.  For more information about what's changed, see the Android Plugin for Gradle Release Notes. If you're ready to upgrade to the new plugin, see Migrate to Android Plugin for Gradle 3.0.0. Kotlin support As announced at Google I/O 2017, the Kotlin programming language is now officially supported on Android

- So with this release, Android Studio includes Kotlin language support for Android development. You can incorporate Kotlin into your project by converting a Java file to Kotlin (click Code  Convert Java File to Kotlin File) or by creating a new Kotlin- enabled project using the New Project wizard. To get started, read how to add Kotlin to your project.  Java 8 language features support You can now use certain Java 8 language features and consume libraries built with Java 8

- Such tools assure our readers that our website can be reached without monitors or blocks, and they provide additional guarantees that readers are connected securely to our website.TechnologyOnion Services exist for other organizations  most notably Facebook and ProPublica, each of which have created custom tooling to support their implementations

- Our Onion Service is built using the open-source Enterprise Onion Toolkit (EOTK), which automates much of the configuration and management effort.The New York Times Onion Service is both experimental and under development

- This means that certain features, such as logins and comments, are disabled until the next phase of our implementation

- We will be fine-tuning site performance, so there may be occasional outages while we make improvements to the service

## Segwit2X  Forked from the get-go?  Brave New Coin

- Announced on May 23rd, The New York Agreement (NYA) is the contract between the Bitcoin miners who represent the majority of Bitcoins hashing power, and a group of over 50 other businesses, to implement the Bitcoin software upgrade Segwit2x.While its no secret that the NYA isnt loved by everyone in the Bitcoin community, a series of events on October 24th left many wondering if the agreement might unravel entirely  leaving the project with no path forward to achieve its goal of upgrading Bitcoin and increasing its block size.The troubles started on Monday morning with a blog post from NYA signatory and major backer Coinbase announcing how they and their subsidiary exchange GDAX would name the split blockchains resulting from the Segwit2x Bitcoin hard fork

- Following the fork, said Coinbase communications director David Farmer, Coinbase will continue referring to the current Bitcoin blockchain as Bitcoin (BTC) and the forked blockchain as Bitcoin2x (B2X).Bitfinex and a few exchanges that did not sign the NYA had previously announced similar naming conventions, while others have said they would not support the Segwit2x altcoin in any way

- However, among those who signed the NYA, Coinbase currently claims 11.4 million Bitcoin-using customers  easily making it one of the most powerful signatories and an influential precedent-setter.What made this announcement particularly important, however, is that by declaring in its naming scheme that the existing Bitcoin blockchain would remain BTC, Coinbase was essentially extinguishing any hope that the Segwit2x blockchain would be an upgrade replacement for the existing blockchain, and in doing so were positioning Segwit2x as just another dividend altcoin like bitcoin cash (BCH) or bitcoin gold (BTG)

- Segwit2xs lead developer, Jeff Garzik himself stated on the Segwit2x development project that this was never the goal of the NYA.For added context, its worth pointing out that the root of the NYAs problems began much earlier

- From the very start there were no Bitcoin Core developers who supported the Segwit2x fork, mainly because they claimed that the plan was too rushed and risky for a system that protects tens of billions of dollars worth of value.Since May, nine NYA signatories have also dropped out for similar reasons  while others have moved over to support the bitcoin cash altcoin

- Then on 11 October, the independently-operated Bitcoin.org website where Bitcoin's primary software is distributed from issued a warning to all Bitcoin users that the fork could cause a major disruption and potentially put bitcoin holders' investments at risk.  Jeff Garzik, CEO of Bloq and MetronomeFast forward to Monday, and things got even more interesting

- Soon after the Coinbase announcement, news broke that Garzik had been working on a competing cryptocurrency called Metronome during the time he has been working on Segwit2x

- Garzik says he plans to release Metronome in December via an ICO sale because bitcoin faces existential threats from forks, developer drama and so on

## Merck's $310m NotPetya bill, stolen RDP logins selling for $10 a pop, bug patches, and more

![lurl](https://media1.giphy.com/media/oqGGcRmYQuyDS/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99dc7a704636775b3a01)

-  Roundup While the security world has been in full Holy Grail mode with BadRabbit, plenty of other stuff has been going on this week

- Here's a roundup of everything else you need to know on top of what we've already reported. On the vulnerability front, it was something of a quiet week

- Google updated Chrome with a new build (62.0.3202.73) to fix a handful of flaws, notably a nasty stack-overflow screwup in its V8 JavaScript engine, some memory issues, and an exploitable bug in its software that could crash the browser

- Make sure you grab the latest version. Apache OpenOffice users also need to get patching

- Cisco's Talos security team found three critical flaws in the dying software suite, and patches are ready and waiting

- Maybe a good time to try LibreOffice? Just sayin'. The trifecta of OpenOffice trouble included a flaw in WW8Fonts for the suite's word processing package, an out-of-bound write vulnerability exists in the PPTStyleSheet:PPTStyleSheet function of the Draw application, and a similar issue with WW8RStyle::ImportOldFormatStyles in the Write app. And in worrying news for whistleblowers, the makers of the secure tell-all tool SecureDrop committed an embarrassing blunder

- It turned out the installation code misconfigured Ansible, and caused three packages (Tor, NTP, and the Tor keyring) to be installed without automatically checking the dependencies' cryptographic signatures

- In other words, if you work for an interesting organization and deployed SecureDrop, anyone able to tamper with your downloads could alter them to unmask your sources or cause other havoc. Also, if you deploy virtual machines on Amazon EC2 with multiple users able to login, be aware they can get at your access keys.  Today I learned non-root EC2 users can curl localhost metadata and get plaintext IAM Access Keys

## uncaptcha

-  Defeating Google's audio reCaptcha system with 85% accuracy

-  Inspiration Across the Internet, hundreds of thousands of sites rely on Google's reCaptcha system for defense against bots (in fact, Devpost uses reCaptcha when creating a new account)

- After a Google research team demonstrated a near complete defeat of the text reCaptcha in 2012, the reCaptcha system evolved to rely on audio and image challenges, historically more difficult challenges for automated systems to solve

- Google has continually iterated on its design, releasing a newer and more powerful version as recently as just this year

- Successfully demonstrating a defeat of this captcha system spells significant vulnerability for hundreds of thousands of popular sites. What it does Our unCaptcha system has attack capabilities written for the audio captcha

- Using browser automation software, we can interact with the target website and engage with the captcha, parsing out the necessary elements to begin the attack

- We rely primarily on the audio captcha attack - by properly identifying spoken numbers, we can pass the reCaptcha programmatically and fool the site into thinking our bot is a human

- Specifically, unCaptcha targets the popular site Reddit by going through the motions of creating a new user, although unCaptcha stops before creating the user to mitigate the impact on Reddit. Background Google's reCaptcha system uses an advanced risk analysis system to determine programmatically how likely a given user is to be a human or a bot

## Mozilla devs discuss ditching Dutch CA, because cryptowars

-  Concerns at the effect of The Netherlands' new security laws could result in the country's certificate authority being pulled from Mozilla's trust list. The nation's Information and Security Services Act will come into force in January 2018

- The law includes metadata retention powers similar to those enacted in other countries, and also grants broad-based interception powers to Dutch security services. Mozilla maintainers worry that interception could be enabled by abusing SSL proxying, giving rise to the proposal that the national CA  the CA of the Staat der Nederlanden  be taken off Firefox's automatic trust list. Chris Van Pelt, who reported the issue, writes: This revision of the law will authorise intelligence and security to intercept and analyse cable-bound (Internet) traffic, and will include far-reaching authorisations, including covert technical attacks, to facilitate their access to encrypted traffic. Article 45 1.b, explicitly authorises the use of 'false keys' in third party systems to obtain access to systems and data, he continues. Van Pelt also argues that the law reaches far beyond The Netherlands, since the country is home to major transit services into and out of Europe. Since the certificate authority in question is operated by The Netherlands' General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD), Van Pelt suggests accepting the certificate is no longer appropriate. The proposal has yet to move beyond the initial Mozilla ticket

## Entrapment by app: how Egypt is cracking down on sexual 'deviancy'

-  Cairo: Egyptian authorities are luring gay men to hotel rooms using dating app Grindr and then arresting them, as an obsession with "penetration" and a violent crackdown on sexual minorities continues.Dozens of police reports unearthed by Dalia Abdel-Hameed, a gender rights researcher with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, outline a "cultivation" technique where potential targets are seduced through dating apps to come to places such as hotel rooms, and then immediately arrested.  The rainbow flag demonstration at a concert in Cairo has prompted a vicious crackdown

- Photo: Facebook: Rainbow Egypt  "It's related to the fact that men are using apps more than women and an obsession of who is being penetrated," Ms Abdel-Hameed said."There is this penetration mania in Egypt due to religious reasons, mostly."  Eight Egyptian men were convicted for "inciting debauchery" in 2014 following their appearance in a video of an alleged same-sex wedding party

- Photo: AP  More than 57 people - most of them gay men - have been arrested in recent weeks on charges of debauchery and spreading pornographic material, several after being lured through popular social dating apps by the morality police, part of the state security apparatus.The latest crackdown on LGBTIQ citizens has come after activists waved a rainbow flag at a rock concert by the Lebanese band Mashrou' Leila last month

-  Flag whips up moral panic When photos of the flag raised by Ahmed Alaa, a 22-year-old Egyptian law student, and his friends went viral, the expression of LGBTIQ solidarity quickly turned into a repressive campaign that has accelerated Egypt's attack on human rights under president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. A vicious social media campaign, aided by traditional loyalist mass media, has whipped up a moral panic about sexual mores.  Hamed Sinno, lead singer and songwriter of the Lebanese group Mashrou' Leila

- Photo: AP  "I was actually at the Mashrou' Leila concert that sparked the whole issue

- I was standing in the back and I saw the raising of the rainbow flag happen from a distance," said Mariam, who preferred to use a pseudonym for her safety."I was a bit nervous even when buying the tickets

- I knew that there could be a security risk even if that band had performed in Egypt many times before," she told Fairfax Media.  Mashrou' Leila in concert in Lebanon in August

- Photo: New York Times  One man arrested in the latest wave was sentenced to six years in jail on the charge of practicing debauchery on his way home from the concert."People are living in fear and persecution," Ms Abdel-Hameed says

## Apple fires iPhone X engineer after daughters hands-on video goes viral

-  Apple has reportedly dismissed an engineer after his daughters iPhone X hands-on video went viral on YouTube

- Brooke Amelia Peterson published a vlog earlier this week, which included a trip to the Apple campus to visit her father and see an unreleased iPhone X

- Petersons video was quickly picked up by sites like 9to5Mac, and it spread even further on YouTube. Peterson now claims her father has been fired as a result of her video

- In a tearful video, Peterson explains her father violated an Apple company rule by allowing her to film the unreleased handset at Apples campus

- Apple reportedly requested that Peterson remove the video, but it was clearly too late as the content spread further and further. The video itself may have seemed like an innocent hands-on, but it did include footage of an iPhone X with special employee-only QR codes

- A notes app was also shown on the iPhone X in the video, which appeared to include codenames of unreleased Apple products

- Filming on Apples campus is strictly prohibited, so filming an unreleased iPhone X is a definite rule violation. Weve seen similar dismissals in the past

- A Microsoft employee was dismissed after his son posted pictures of the Xbox 360 before its release

## Malicious Chrome Extension Steals Data Posted to Any Website

- Malicious browser extensions continue to bear fruit for hackers who have been using them to spread banking malware and adware, and hijacking popular add-ons to spread other nasty code. The latest abuse involves a Google Chrome extension being spread in phishing emails that steals any data posted online by victims

- This is a departure from previous attacks that monitor browser activity for specific URLs and extract credentials.Related Posts   Taking HTTPS Denial to an Absurd Level   November 2, 2017 , 2:01 pm     Devilish ONI Attacks in Japan Use Wiper to Cover Tracks   November 2, 2017 , 9:44 am     Silence Gang Borrows From Carbanak To Steal From Banks   November 1, 2017 , 12:24 pm    This campaign may be limited to Brazil and other Portuguese-speaking nations, according to Renato Marinho, chief research officer at Morphus Labs and a SANS Internet Storm Center (ISC) handler

- Marinho told Threatpost that the phishing message is written in Portuguese and some characteristics associated with compromised computers including directory names leads him to believe the malware used in these attacks originated in Brazil. Based on the messages I received on my spam trap, the campaign is ongoing and possible making many victims, Marinho said. The emails, Marinho said, include a lure hinting at photos from a weekend event sent over WhatsApp (Segue as (Fotos Final de Semana ) Enviadas via WhatsApp (30244))

- Should the victim click on the link, a malware dropper called whatsapp.exe is executed and presents a phony Adobe Reader installer, which downloads and installs a .cab file on the victims computer

- The .cab file is a 9.5MB compressed file that spews a pair of 200MB-plus files once decompressed, Marinho wrote in a report to the SANS ISC site

- Most of the code, he said, is bloat in an attempt to bypass anti-malware scanners that avoid large files. One of the files attempts to disable the Windows Firewall and kill all Chrome processes before installing the malicious browser extension, written in JavaScript. The extension captures all data posted by the victim on any website, Marinho said, before its sent to a command and control server using jQuery and Ajax connections. Marinho added that existing browser security measures such as SSL or TLS wont protect the victims because the stolen data is captured in clear text inside the browser, before it is sent through HTTPS connection. Thats another reason this is approach is attractive to cybercriminals, Marinho said. Marinho said he expects cybercriminals to continue to make use of malicious extensions to access a victims personal or sensitive data. It wasnt necessary for the attacker to attract the victim to a fake website with doubtful SSL certificates or deploying local proxies to intercept web connections

- Quite the opposite, the user is accessing original and legitimate websites and all the interactions are working properly while data is captured and leaked, he said

- In my opinion, internet browsers should better control extensions and plugins installation processes as the Android and IOS mobile ecosystems do

-  Google's platform to deal with bugs and unpatched vulnerabilities had a bug that allowed a security researcher to see a full list of known, unpatched vulnerabilities within Google, creating a kind of bug inception that could have led to more damaging hacks.  Alex Birsan, a security researcher, found three vulnerabilities inside the Google Issue Tracker, the company's internal platform where employees keep track of requested features or unpatched bugs in Google's products

- The largest one of these was one that allowed him to access the internal platform at all

- The company has quickly patched the bugs found by Birsan, and there's no evidence anyone else found the bugs and exploited them

-   Still, these were bad bugs, especially the one that gave him access to the bug-tracking platform, which could have provided hackers with a list of vulnerable targets at Google

-   "Exploiting this bug gives you access to every vulnerability report anyone sends to Google until they catch on to the fact that you're spying on them," Birsan told Motherboard in an online chat

> "Turning those vulnerability reports into working attacks also takes some time/skill

- But the bigger the impact, the quicker it gets fixed by Google

- So even if you get lucky and catch a good one as soon as it's reported, you still have to have a plan for what you do with it."  A Google spokesperson said in an email statement: "We appreciate Alex's report

## Staaldraad

-  A few weeks back Saif El-Sherei and I posted on the SensePost blog about DDE and getting command exec in MSWord without macros

- This post got way more attention than we initially expected it would

- Since then DDE has been used in phishing and malware campaigns, as well as legitimate red-team engagements

- With the rapid rise in attacks using DDE, detection has been stepped up and most AV engines have basic DDE detection built in

- Most of this detection has been based around YARA rules, which identify the DDE or DDEAUTO strings in .docx and .doc files

- This got me wondering if it would be possible to obfuscate the DDE out of the document

- One or two attempts at this have emerged, with threat-actors changing the case of the DDE string, and splitting it across multiple lines as described here; Macroless DOC malware that avoids detection with Yara rule. In this post Ill share my attempts at obfuscation and detection bypass

- Hopefully this will be helpful for both attack and defence.  Obfuscating the payload Hiding DDE/DDEAUTO Defensive notes  Payload Obfuscation Before digging into ways of obfuscating the DDE and DDEAUTO field codes, I decided to focus on obfuscating the payload

## Yubico launches YubiHSM 2: The smallest, cheapest Hardware Security Module (HSM) | ZDNet

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/3Cpj1wgUwH5Kw/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99e5496c6c566bffb60e)

-                Yubico, the leading provider of authentication and encryption hardware devices, has today unveiled the YubiHSM 2, a new, cost-effective Hardware Security Module (HSM) for servers and IoT gateways. But the YubiHSM 2 is different to existing HSM devices in that it is an ultra-slim "nano" USB key that slots inside a USB port, doing away with the need for bulky additional hardware, and offers flexibility for offline key transfer or backup. YubiHSM 2 features include:Secure Microsoft's Active Directory Certificate Services: YubiHSM 2 provides a cost-effective hardware-backed key to secure digital keys used in a Microsoft-based PKI implementation

- Deploying YubiHSM 2 to Microsoft Active Directory Certificate services not only guards the CA root keys but also protects all signing and verification services using the root key.Enhance Protection for Cryptographic Keys: YubiHSM 2 offers a compelling option for secure generation, storage and management of digital keys including essential capabilities to generate, write, sign, decrypt, hash, and wrap keys.Enable Hardware-Based Cryptographic Operations: YubiHSM 2 can be used as a comprehensive cryptographic toolbox for a wide range of open source and commercial applications

- The most common use case being hardware-based digital signature generation and verification

- The YubiHSM 2 features can be accessed through Yubico's Key Storage Provider (KSP) for industry-standard PKCS#11 or Microsoft's CNG, or via native Windows, Linux, and macOS libraries.16 concurrent connections: Multiple applications can establish sessions with a YubiHSM to perform cryptographic operations

- Sessions can be automatically terminated after inactivity or be long-lived to improve performance by eliminating session creation time.Remote Management: Easily manage multiple deployed YubiHSMs remotely for the entire enterprise -- eliminate on-call staff complexity and travel expense."Nano" form factor, low-power usage: The "Nano" form factor allows the HSM to be inserted completely into a USB-A port so it's completely concealed -- no external parts that protrude out of the server back or front chassis

- It uses minimal power, max of 30mA, for cost-savings on your power budget.Broad platform support: Linux, Windows, and macOS. Additional features include, optional network-sharing, role-based access controls, M of N wrap key backup and restore, tamper evident audit logging, and extensive cryptographic capabilities (RSA, ECC, ECDSA (ed25519), SHA-2, and AES).    "It's estimated that 95 percent of all IT breaches happen when a user credential or server gets hacked

- For years Yubico has been protecting user accounts from remote hijacking with our unphishable YubiKey authentication devices, but we knew that millions of servers storing sensitive data were still lacking physical security," said Stina Ehrensvard, CEO and Founder, Yubico

> "It was important to us that we brought a solution to market that embodied the signature Yubico standards of high-security, convenience, and affordability

## [dns-operations] Surprisingly large cluster of domains sharing the same pair of 512-bit ZSKs and some more RSA key oddities

-  Looking closely at the data gathered by the DANE survey I've run into more than 54 thousand (!!!) domains that have the same pair of 512-bit RSA keys for their ZSKs

- A small sample follows my signature

- The SOA records all point at wedos.cz, who appear to be some sort of hosting provider

- Perhaps someone native to .CZ could reach out to them and suggest that 512-bit keys are no longer a good idea, especially if re-used so liberally! The only sensible feature of these is that the exponent is the usual F_4

- Two domains unrelated to the above have 512-bit keys with a weak exponent of 3: trt12.jus.br trt12.gov.br More broadly, the DNSKEY length (including exponent length and exponent) histogram (distinct RR count) for keys for algorithms 5, 7, 8 and 10 (RSA) is below, with some highlights annotated

Computer Science  Learning  Title: One pixel attack for fooling deep neural networks (Submitted on 24 Oct 2017)  Abstract: Recent research has revealed that the output of Deep neural networks(DNN) is not continuous and very sensitive to tiny perturbation on the input vectors and accordingly several methods have been proposed for crafting effective perturbation against the networks

- In this paper, we propose a novel method for optically calculating extremely small adversarial perturbation (few-pixels attack), based on differential evolution

- It requires much less adversarial information and works with a broader classes of DNN models

- The results show that 73.8$\%$ of the test images can be crafted to adversarial images with modification just on one pixel with 98.7$\%$ confidence on average

- In addition, it is known that investigating the robustness problem of DNN can bring critical clues for understanding the geometrical features of the DNN decision map in high dimensional input space

- The results of conducting few-pixels attack contribute quantitative measurements and analysis to the geometrical understanding from a different perspective compared to previous works

## Yubico launches YubiHSM 2: The smallest, cheapest Hardware Security Module (HSM) | ZDNet

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/3Cpj1wgUwH5Kw/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99e5496c6c566bffb60e)

-                Yubico, the leading provider of authentication and encryption hardware devices, has today unveiled the YubiHSM 2, a new, cost-effective Hardware Security Module (HSM) for servers and IoT gateways. But the YubiHSM 2 is different to existing HSM devices in that it is an ultra-slim "nano" USB key that slots inside a USB port, doing away with the need for bulky additional hardware, and offers flexibility for offline key transfer or backup. YubiHSM 2 features include:Secure Microsoft's Active Directory Certificate Services: YubiHSM 2 provides a cost-effective hardware-backed key to secure digital keys used in a Microsoft-based PKI implementation

- Deploying YubiHSM 2 to Microsoft Active Directory Certificate services not only guards the CA root keys but also protects all signing and verification services using the root key.Enhance Protection for Cryptographic Keys: YubiHSM 2 offers a compelling option for secure generation, storage and management of digital keys including essential capabilities to generate, write, sign, decrypt, hash, and wrap keys.Enable Hardware-Based Cryptographic Operations: YubiHSM 2 can be used as a comprehensive cryptographic toolbox for a wide range of open source and commercial applications

- The most common use case being hardware-based digital signature generation and verification

- The YubiHSM 2 features can be accessed through Yubico's Key Storage Provider (KSP) for industry-standard PKCS#11 or Microsoft's CNG, or via native Windows, Linux, and macOS libraries.16 concurrent connections: Multiple applications can establish sessions with a YubiHSM to perform cryptographic operations

- Sessions can be automatically terminated after inactivity or be long-lived to improve performance by eliminating session creation time.Remote Management: Easily manage multiple deployed YubiHSMs remotely for the entire enterprise -- eliminate on-call staff complexity and travel expense."Nano" form factor, low-power usage: The "Nano" form factor allows the HSM to be inserted completely into a USB-A port so it's completely concealed -- no external parts that protrude out of the server back or front chassis

- It uses minimal power, max of 30mA, for cost-savings on your power budget.Broad platform support: Linux, Windows, and macOS. Additional features include, optional network-sharing, role-based access controls, M of N wrap key backup and restore, tamper evident audit logging, and extensive cryptographic capabilities (RSA, ECC, ECDSA (ed25519), SHA-2, and AES).    "It's estimated that 95 percent of all IT breaches happen when a user credential or server gets hacked

- For years Yubico has been protecting user accounts from remote hijacking with our unphishable YubiKey authentication devices, but we knew that millions of servers storing sensitive data were still lacking physical security," said Stina Ehrensvard, CEO and Founder, Yubico

> "It was important to us that we brought a solution to market that embodied the signature Yubico standards of high-security, convenience, and affordability

## Fine, OK, no backdoors, says Deputy AG. Just keep PLAINTEXT copies of everyone's messages

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/dykJfX4dbM0Vy/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99ea2e7a4b7563f38c74)

-  The US Deputy Attorney General has told business leaders that Uncle Sam won't demand mandatory backdoors in encryption  so long as companies can cough up an unencrypted copy of every message, call, photo or other form of communications they handle. Speaking at the 2017 North American International Cyber Summit in Detroit on Monday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appeared to shift tack on his earlier position that end-to-end encryption systems, such as instant messengers and video call apps, should grant special access exclusively to crime investigators on demand. Tech giants are resisting weakening their strong end-to-end and filesystem crypto just to help cops and Feds arbitrarily decipher suspects' messages and files on devices

- So, Rosenstein has another approach: let people send stuff encrypted as normal, but a plaintext copy of everything  from communications to files on devices  must be retained in an unencrypted form for investigators to delve into as needed. "Encryption serves a valuable purpose

- It is a foundational element of data security and essential to safeguarding data against cyber-attacks

- It is critical to the growth and flourishing of the digital economy, and we support it

- I support strong and responsible encryption," he said. "I simply maintain that companies should retain the capability to provide the government unencrypted copies of communications and data stored on devices, when a court orders them to do so." Despite the fact that doing this would be a massive money and time suck, in terms of storage capacity and processing, it also kind of takes the point out of using encrypted conversations for privacy

- It also means that any hacker who breaks into these archives would have access to the crown jewels of personal and corporate secrets.  'There has never been a right to absolute privacy'  US Deputy AG slams 'warrant-proof' crypto READ MORE Mind you, that would surely never happen

- We never come across stories about servers getting hacked, and certainly the government is immune from such incidents, especially where they involve staffers' fingerprints and security clearances. Rosenstein prefaced his suggestions with dire warnings about the effects of online crime

- Since January 1 last year, there has been an average of 4,000 ransomware "attacks" a day, up 300 per cent on the previous year, he claimed, and said the FBI warned him ransomware infects more than 100,000 computers a day around the world. In other scary news, Rosenstein warned that botnets  commandeered internet-of-things devices  could end up crashing large chunks of the internet

## Say what? Another reCaptcha attack, now against audio challenges

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/JfDNFU1qOZna/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99eb7374397163e22223)

-  Whatever Google has in mind to replace its reCaptcha had better be ready soon: another research group has found a way to defeat it. Late last week, researchers from startup Vicarious demonstrated their attack against reCaptcha's image-based I'm not a robot proof

- Now University of Maryland boffins have busted Google's audio accessibility feature. The University's Kevin Bock, Daven Patel, George Hughey and Dave Levin call unCaptcha a low-resource defeat of the audio challenge that usually beats reCaptcha less time than it takes to even play the audio challenge! By the numbers, they claim 85.15 per cent accuracy in 5.42 seconds over 450 reCaptcha challenges from live Websites. The secret to getting cracking reCaptcha's audio so quickly? The cloud, of course: rather than running their own audio analysis, the researchers used multiple online speech-to-text services, as described in full in this paper [PDF]:  Download the audio captcha; Segment the audio into individual digit audio clips; Upload each segment to multiple online speech-to-text services; Convert these services' responses to digits including:  Exact homophones: If it is "one" "two", etc., then guess that number Near homophones: If it sounds like a digit, like "true" sounds like "two", then guess what it sounds like Ensemble the multiple services together by taking a weighted vote based on confidence;   And finally upload the answer.  Some of this had already been demonstrated, the researchers explain, in a project called ReBreakCaptcha posted at GitHub in February. The University of Maryland researchers say their main contribution is in improving audio pre-processing, so the online speech-to-text converters work more accurately. Segmenting the audio, the paper explains, is easy: with no background noise added to reCaptcha, the pre-processing need only identify silence

- With the segments identified, unCaptcha then adds two steps not attempted in ReBreakCaptcha: phonetic mapping, and ensembling. The phonetic mapping stage handles things like homophones (too/two/to/2) and near-homophones (free/3, sex/6  the latter, of course, a true homophone in New Zealand) so that what's passed to the speech-to-text engine gets a more accurate result. Ensembling helps sort out which speech-to-text engines are most accurate by weighting results: In essence, each candidate answer gets a weighted vote; the answer with the highest weight wins, the paper says. Possible countermeasures the paper suggests include giving reCaptcha a bigger vocabulary for its audio challenges, adding background noise to make it harder to segment the challenge into individual words, or making the challenge a set of instructions like move your mouse upwards or type this word

## A draft US law to secure election computers that isn't braindead. Well, I'm stunned! I gotta lie down

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/l46C6n5ggnoD81yyA/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99ec6c4d4f5451675636)

-  A law bill was introduced today to the US Senate designed to safeguard American elections from hacking by miscreants or manipulation by Russian or other foreign agents. The Securing America's Voting Equipment (SAVE) Act [PDF] would designate elections systems as part of the US national critical infrastructure, task the Comptroller General of the United States with checking the integrity of voting machines, and sponsor a "Hack the election" competition to find flaws in voting machines. "Our democracy hinges on protecting Americans' ability to fairly choose our own leaders

- We must do everything we can to protect the security and integrity of our elections," said cosponsor Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM). "The SAVE Act would ensure states are better equipped to develop solutions and respond to threats posed to election systems

- Until we set up stronger protections of our election systems and take the necessary steps to prevent future foreign influence campaigns, our nation's democratic institutions will remain vulnerable." If passed by both the House of Reps as well as the Senate, and signed into law by President Pence, the proposed legislation would instruct the Director of National Intelligence to perform a security clearance check on the chief election official of each state and one designee, and  after they passed  would keep them updated on current and projected hacking threats. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security would be given the job of developing a threat assessment model for hacking election systems and develop a best practice guide to protect them

- States would also get a grant to buy new, and hopefully more secure, voting machines.  'Influence'  "While the Intelligence Committee's investigation is still ongoing, one thing is clear: the Russians were very active in trying to influence the 2016 election and will continue their efforts to undermine public confidence in democracies," said cosponsor Senator Susan Collins (R-ME). "The fact that the Russians probed the election-related systems of 21 states is truly disturbing, and it must serve as a call to action to assist states in hardening their defenses against foreign adversaries that seek to compromise the integrity of our election process

- Our bipartisan legislation would assist states in this area by identifying best practices to protecting voting equipment, and ensuring states have the resources they need to implement those best practices."  Homeland Security: Putins hackers tried to crack electoral networks in 21 US states READ MORE The dire state of election machine security was amply demonstrated at this year's DEF CON hacking convention in Las Vegas

- A squad of enthusiasts managed to compromise election machines with ease, either in person or remotely, to potentially alter final tallies for candidates. The election equipment hacking, which will be repeated next year, proved remarkably easy

- Many of the voting machines were still running Windows XP, few were properly patched, and the resulting furor caused the state of Virginia to scrap its own voting machines. But not everyone is so concerned

- Georgia  which doesn't even give voters a paper receipt for their vote that can be used in recounts - recently managed to wipe a computer server that was crucial to a lawsuit probing possible election blunders in the state. There is a simple technical fix to ensure elections are a lot harder to hack, and it's a low-tech fix: paper

## America's 2020 Census systems are a $15bn cyber-security tire fire

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/TI8yz4eu34zDO/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99ed316a63786bda24ee)

-  Analysis In 2020, America will run its once-a-decade national census, but the results may not reflect reality if hackers manage to have their way. On Tuesday, the US Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee heard that the 2020 census will be the first to make extensive use of electronic equipment

- For example, census workers will be given tablets to interview people who can't be bothered filling in and sending back their forms. Crucially, the US Census Bureau must patch vulnerabilities and install strong defenses in the computer systems it has set up to find and tabulate American citizens

- With less than three years to go, a little more hustle in that department is needed, it seems.  A draft US law to secure election computers that isn't braindead

- Well, I'm stunned! I gotta lie down READ MORE "The bureau has not addressed several security risks and challenges to secure its systems and data, including making certain that security assessments are completed in a timely manner and that risks are at an acceptable level," Eugene Dodaro, the US Comptroller General, said in a statement read out during the Senate hearing. "It is important that the bureau quickly address these challenges." Previously, the census was recorded by mailing paper forms to every household in the country, and then dispatching data collectors to quiz citizens who dont return their completed paperwork

- Dodaro reported that "because the nations population is growing larger, more diverse, and more reluctant to participate," response rates were at an historic low: just 63 per cent of households replied by mail in 2010 compared to 78 per cent in 1970. As a result, the bureau had to recruit a load of temporary workers to manually obtain people's details

- After the 2010 census, someone had the bright idea to make the process more electronic, with workers using fondleslabs to input data. This was billed as a cost-saving measure but those familiar with large IT projects can see where this is going

- The 2010 census cost $12.3bn to carry out, up 31 per cent on the 2000 poll, and the 2020 exercise is expected to cost $15.6bn, and costs may yet rise higher. Part of the reason for the massive cost increase is the aforementioned use of handheld electronic devices by workers

- The data collectors were supposed to use their own phones when out in the field, but this was scrapped once someone, thankfully, thought through the security and compatibility implications.  High tech doesn't equal secure  Dodaro said the US Government Accountability Office has identified 43 electronic systems that are to be used in the 2020 census

## FBI: Student wrestler grappled grades after choking passwords from PCs using a key logger

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/IrdyIk5xm8JgI/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99ee727962336b7e60bf)

-  A former chemistry student allegedly used keystroke-logging gadgets to steal tutors' passwords, changed classmates' grades and downloaded copies of exams ahead of time. Amateur wrestler Trevor Graves, 22, who studied at the University of Iowa, in the US, was arrested and indicted this month on two hacking charges  each of which could land him up to ten years in the clink if found guilty. In paperwork submitted to an Iowa district court, FBI agent Jeffrey Huber recounted that in December last year one of the university's teachers noticed that Graves' grades had mysteriously improved

- The scores were stored in a system called Iowa Courses Online (ICON), and accessing it to edit student records would require passwords only given to teaching assistants and lecturers. The teacher grew suspicious, and reported the unexplained grade change to the college's IT staff, who started digging

- In January, they had gathered evidence showing students in four classes had had their scores bumped up, and that the login credentials of six teaching staff had obviously been purloined and exploited by some unknown miscreant

- The techies called the cops, and issued an alert to staff and students warning them to be on the look out for hardware key-loggers attached to their computers

- It was believed at least one such gadget had been surreptitiously attached to tutors' PCs, and secretly recorded typed-in ICON passwords for the campus hacker to later use. Because Graves' grades had been altered, he immediately fell under suspicion

- In December, FBI agents searched his house while he wasn't there, and said they found thumb drives, two hardware key-loggers, and four smartphones

- One of the thumb drives had a photo of Graves logging into ICON using a professor's identity, and advanced copies of examination questions, the Feds claimed. But Graves was not the only person to have their grades suddenly improved: other students had benefitted too

- So the FBI concentrated on interviewing these other students, and quickly got results, we're told.  Password reset warrior arrested for popping 1050 student accounts READ MORE One student known only as AB was identified from text messages found on one of the phones

## Average Employee Manages Nearly 200 Passwords

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/105XRa8PBzUDV6/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99ef2e554e564d014cbc)

- But single sign-on support lacks in over 50% of the most popular websites and services used by workers.Employees use an average of 191 passwords to enter 154 times in a given month, racking up an estimated 36 minutes of password data entry during that time, according to a report released today. The Password Expose report, based on aggregated and anonymized data from over 30,000 LastPass customers, found that other industry reports often underestimate the number of credentials used and put the figure closer to an average of 27 passwords per employee. In addition to enterprise apps, employees often use dozens of other apps while at work, such as advertising and analytics platform apps as well as demonstration apps, the report notes. Meanwhile, companies and employees do not get full relief by using single sign-on (SSO) technology. Although a number of enterprise apps have SSO capabilities, more than 50% of the most popular websites and services, such as Box, MailChimp, and LinkedIn, do not support SSO out of the box, the report states. As a result, companies are left to put a business password manager in place to ensure all of those websites and services are "captured" and managed by IT policies, says Rachael Stockton, director of product strategy at LastPass. Password vaults with multifactor authentication are enabled in 26.5% of the companies included in the report, a level that lacks broad enough adoption to offset the problems that enterprises face with passwords, according to the report. "Multifactor authentication isn't supported widely enough across Web services, and isn't adopted frequently enough by businesses, to offset the risks that passwords pose," Stockton says

> "While the business community is moving in the right direction, change is happening too slowly

- Until universal coverage with multifactor authentication (or even behavioral or contextual authentication) is available, companies need to invest in strengthening the password-protected services in use across the entire organization." Another recent study found that while corporate America's use of passwords remains prevalent, multifactor authentication is showing some signs of growth in the enterprise

- Javelin Strategy  Research's 2017 State of Authentication Report found 100% of enterprises continue to use passwords, despite industry calls to ditch them all together or at least bolster security through a combination of passwords and other measures, such as biometrics and public key infrastructure. Password vaults also grow exponentially, the study found

- The average employee starts with 20 credentials in their password vault and within three months that number doubles, according to the report

- LastPass, in a report from last year, found that 91% of users were aware of the risks of reusing passwords, yet 61% continued with the practice. Business and Personal Password Use IntermingledRoughly half of the top 36 popular websites that employees access for work are consumer solutions, such as Dropbox, Google, and Evernote, the report states

- But the owners of these accounts are likely the employees, even though sensitive work-related data is likely stored on these accounts. "The line between 'business' and 'personal' apps is a blurry one

- People are often using personal accounts in the workplace, and may even be doing work or sharing work data in those personal accounts," says Stockton. The report also points to a recent Ovum study that found 23% of workers will use their social media credentials to log in to business systems and applications, as well. "It was very surprising to learn that businesses were allowing access to their data through sites protected only by personal passwords that they have no control over," Stockton adds. In citing the problems with this practice, Stockton says the first one is control

## Vlad the blockader: Russia's anti-VPN law comes into effect

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/i7HHpE0KET0B2/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99f02f684d5a551f9239)

-  A Russian law that bans the use or provision of virtual private networks (VPNs) will come into effect Wednesday. The legislation will require ISPs to block websites that offer VPNs and similar proxy services that are used by millions of Russians to circumvent state-imposed internet censorship. It was signed by President Vladimir Putin on July 29 and was justified as a necessary measure to prevent the spread of extremism online

- Its real impact, however, will be to make it much harder for ordinary Russians to access websites ISPs are instructed to block connections to by Russian regulator Roskomnadzor, aka the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media. Among those banned websites are Wikipedia  placed on the list on the pretext that it contained information about taking drugs  and numerous pornographic websites, as well as some genuinely extremist outlets such as The Daily Stormer. But the bigger issue and concern are short-term bans that have been repeatedly placed on news websites when they report on topics that the Russian government considers sensitive. For example, during Russia's annexation of Crimea  an action that led to international condemnation and the imposition of sanctions  several Russian publications that criticized the move found themselves blacklisted. The regulator has also shut down significant online resources on the basis on one small issue: such as when it removed access to GitHub because some notes appeared somewhere on the sprawling service that outlined suicide methods (GitHub now publishes Russian government takedown requests)

- Roskomnadzor also cut off access to Amazon Web Services for several hours because it decided it didnt like a poker app hosted somewhere on its systems.  It gets worse  The law is just one part of a concerted effort by the Russian government to restrict access to information online

- While Russia does not appear to be going the same route as China  which has a country wide, constantly maintained censorship apparatus, known as the Great Firewall of China  it is clearly following its lead. At the same time as Putin signed the VPN legislation, he signed another that will come into effect in January

- That law, like a similar one passed by the Chinese government earlier this year, will require operators of messaging services to verify their users' identities through phone numbers

- And it will require operators to introduce systems to cut off any users that are deemed by the Russian government to be spreading illegal content. At the same time, Russia is using its sway at the United Nations to push a much more restrictive approach to the internet: something that many Western governments fear will lead to a gradual shutting down of the open internet. As with China, Russia constantly points to the threat of extremism and terrorism as reasons for introducing greater controls, but both countries have started expanding that control to cover social issues. China has decided it should block any information that does not reflect the country's "core socialist values"  something that swiftly led to it cutting off access to Japanese animations and South Korean soap operas as well as banning Justin Bieber from performing in the country due to his "bad behavior." And, of course, that censorship is frequently used to shut down dissenting voices, especially those that the political establishment fear pose a threat to them

- The most stark, and depressing, recent example came when China deleted, in real time, images of Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo as he was dying in a government-controlled hospital of liver cancer. Russia's internet crackdowns will also come into force just months ahead of a March 2018 election in which Vladimir Putin will run for a new six-year term

- You can expect to see the new laws vigorously imposed against anyone challenging Putin's claim to perpetual power

## Bypassing Browser Security Warnings with Pseudo Password Fields

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/3o6MbfdywJmn5V4IA8/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99f3364e624a4d9939ff)

- It seems that there is no limit to human ingenuity when it comes to working around limitations within one's environment

- For example, imagine you genuinely wanted to run a device requiring mains power in the centre of your inflatable pool - you're flat out of luck, right? Wrong!  Or imagine there's a fire somewhere but the hydrant is on the other side of train tracks and you really want to put that fire out but trains have still gotta run too - what options are you left with? None? Wrong again!  Seeing a theme here? Let's extend that into the digital world and we'll talk about HTTPS for a bit

- You should use it

- No really, if you're not HTTPS'ing all your things then you're doing it wrong

- The browser vendors know this and they're increasingly holding non-compliant websites to account

- That really ramped up in Jan when both Chrome and Firefox started displaying warnings when a login form was served insecurely

- Not everyone was happy about this because hey, HTTPS is hard, right? No, it's not, but that didn't stop Oil and Gas International from logging a bug report with Mozilla:  Your notice of insecure password and/or log-in automatically appearing on the log-in for my website, Oil and Gas International is not wanted and was put there without our permission

- Please remove it immediately

## Just one day after its release, iOS 11.1 hacked by security researchers | ZDNet

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/12vuBe8yGNb1Fm/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99f72f6f78426b977b75)

- two bugs -- one in the browser and one in a system service that let a malicious app persist through a reboot.

- Another bug in Safari let researchers break the browser's sandbox and execute malicious code.

- The bugs earned the researchers $70,000 in awards.

- pecific details of the exploits won't be made public until Apple fixes the bugs, or a three-month period of responsible disclosure expires -- whichever is first.

## LineageOS for microG  Access Google services without closed software

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/CLry75tSqZmow/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fc99f9586c37716bed964b)

- built-in microG free-as-in-freedom re-implementation of Google's proprietary Android user space apps and libraries

- This enables you to use every Google service you need without keeping another closed-source binary blob in your Android system.

- LineageOS for microG comes with F-Droid already installed

- You can use it to access plenty of FOSS applications or even a Play Store bridge repository like Playmaker or GPlayWeb.

- Our ROM and LineageOS use different signing keys, so you can't flash our ROM on top of the official LineageOS; however, the procedure needed to migrate from the official LineageOS is very simple.

## RIP HPKP: Google abandons public key pinning

- HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) is a standard that allows a host to instruct browsers to only accept certain public keys when communicating with it for a given period of time

- Google's Chris Palmer announced plans to deprecate HPKP support by Chrome from May next year  when Chrome 67 is slated to be released to Stable

- web developers should use the Expect-CT header, including its reporting function

- Expect-CT is safer than HPKP due to the flexibility it gives site operators to recover from any configuration errors, and due to the built-in support offered by a number of CAs.
